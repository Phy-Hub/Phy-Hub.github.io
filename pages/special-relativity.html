<span style="display: hidden">\(\nextSection\)</span>
To make sense of special relativity, we will first look at the classical understanding of the world.
Then, we will see how we must change these classical laws of physics to account for light's constant speed relative to all observers.
Which in turn will lead to many interesting consequences.
The chapter begins with an overview of the core concepts to help us understand why we need special relativity and what it means, leaving the mathematical details and deeper insights for the following chapters.
This chapter's concepts will establish the mathematical framework for later chapters, using physical objects, such as moving trucks on roads, to represent the different perspectives of various observers.
Whereas, in the mathematical chapters, we will use coordinate axes to represent the different perspectives (frames of reference).
Later, you will see the parallels between this conceptual overview and the mathematical chapters.
This chapter will provide an overview of all the required concepts for special relativity, building up the needed knowledge bit by bit, starting with our classical understanding of how perspectives (frames of reference) work and showing how our understanding must change if we are to allow all observers to view light as moving at the same constant speed.
<h2 id="ClassicalAdditionofVelocities_header">Classical Addition of Velocities</h2>
<div id="ch1_1_content">
Imagine a truck, carrying a cannon, is moving at 20 meters per second, and the cannon fires a ball at 100 meters per second relative to the truck.
Classically, we add the truck and the ball's speed, to find the ball moves at 120 meters per second relative to the road.
So, in classical physics, velocities are directly added.
The ball relative to the road would move at the speed of the ball relative to the truck plus the truck's speed relative to the road, as shown in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: truck cannonball','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: truck cannonball}</span>).
However, this classical understanding is just a very good approximation for objects in our everyday life that we are used to seeing, which are moving much slower than the speed of light (roughly 300 000 000 meters per second), but we will get to this later.
For now, in the following sections, we will explain what an inertial reference frame is and how this works in the classical context so that you can see more clearly the differences between classical and special relativity.

The Figure (bottom) is from the road's perspective, with the truck moving relative to it. When the cannonball is shot, it looks like it is moving forward faster, with the previous cannonball's speed combined with the speed of the cannon that it was shot from. *** add labels of ball, truck and road speed or There could be a background object like a stop sign/person that is blurred in the top and not blurred in the bottom.</figcaption>

<h2 id="InertialReferenceFrame_header">Inertial Reference Frame</h2>
<div id="ch1_2_content">
A reference frame is a grid of coordinates that we can overlay space with, so that we can state with respect to it where and when an event occurs.
If this grid is stationary or moving at a constant velocity, it is called an inertial reference frame.
In the previous truck example, we could associate a reference frame with the truck, by introducing a grid of coordinates that is stationary relative to the truck and, hence, moving along with it.
This perspective, fixed to the truck, is the truck's frame of reference.
A second grid of coordinates, stationary relative to the road, can also be introduced, representing the road's reference frame.
These grids of coordinates are shown from the road's reference frame in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: Reference Frames','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: Reference Frames}</span>).

</figure>
An inertial frame of reference is a reference frame that is not being accelerated.
You can tell if you are being accelerated as you will feel a force.
For example, in an accelerating car, you will feel the seat being accelerated into you, with your body slightly lagging behind in the acceleration.
This principle is used in accelerometers to measure acceleration, as shown in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: spring boxes','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: spring boxes}</span>).
<figure id="fig: spring boxes">

<figcaption>&nbsp;<b>Inertial vs non-inertial frames.</b> A diagram, showing a ball attached to the walls of a box by springs, with the ball centered in the box in the inertial frame, with no acceleration (left), and in a non-inertial frame (right) where the box is now accelerating to the right, The ball lags behind as the box accelerates.</figcaption>
</figure>
We will now look at how movement changes in classical relativity when we change between these inertial frames.

<h2 id="ClassicalInertialReferenceFrames_header">Classical Inertial Reference Frames</h2>
<div id="ch1_3_content">
To see how to swap between <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-Reference-frame').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-Reference-frame').style.display='none'">reference frame</span>s in special relativity, we will first have to introduce the classical approach.
To illustrate this, we will look at a setup of two rats on a treadmill with a platform as shown in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: 3d conveyor belt','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: 3d conveyor belt}</span>), with three rocks hanging above the platform, which are at rest relative to the room.
The two frames of reference will be the treadmill's platform and the room in which the treadmill is in.
Both rats start under the same rock.
One rat runs to a rock positioned in the forward direction of the treadmill.
The other rat runs to an equally distanced rock to the side.
After this, they return to the starting rock.
Here, the platform can be seen as the medium in which the rats move.
Both rats travel at the same constant speed relative to the platform, with the platform either at rest or at a slower speed than the rat's motion to allow them to get to the rocks.
<figure id="fig: 3d conveyor belt">
<img src="../topics/special-relativity/Latex/images/svg/Conveyor_belt_3d.svg" style="width:100%; height:auto;" loading="lazy">
<figcaption>&nbsp;<b>Rats on a treadmill.</b> A diagram, showing a 3d view of a treadmill platform, with two rats and three hanging rocks, with arrows representing the rats moving from a starting rock to the other two equally distanced rocks, with the paths perpendicular to each other.</figcaption>
</figure>
If the platform is at rest, they will return to the starting rock simultaneously.
But if the treadmill is turned on and the platform is moving, the rats will also have to work against the movement of the platform to get to the rocks.
This will lead to different distances the rats have to travel relative to the platform, and as a result, the rats get back to the starting rock at different times.
Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: treadmill','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: treadmill}</span>) shows what the direction of movement of the rats and rocks look like in each of the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-Reference-frame').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-Reference-frame').style.display='none'">reference frame</span>s when the platform is moving.

From the room's perspective, the platform is moving backwards.
The rat that is moving along the direction of the treadmill's motion will have impedance to its movement from the backwards pull of the platform.
But after it turns around, it will have a boost from the platform to return to the starting rock.
Meanwhile, the sideways-moving rat will have to move sideways and balance out the platform's backwards pull to keep its movement in the direction of the hanging rocks.
This gives different lengths of paths depending on the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-Reference-frame').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-Reference-frame').style.display='none'">reference frame</span>, as shown in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: treadmill','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: treadmill}</span>).
The rats in the platform's reference frame, move with the same speed for all the paths, represented by the arrows.
Whereas, in the room's reference frame, we have a slower constant speed of the sideways-moving rat and two different speeds for the forward and backward paths of the other rat.
This leads to different times for the rats to return to the starting rock.
The rats here use the medium of the treadmill's platform to move, and similarly, it was thought that light needed a medium, called the aether, to travel through space.
If there was this medium, we could test how fast it moved relative to Earth by finding the difference between the return times of light emitted in two perpendicular directions, just as in the treadmill example.
So, next, we will look at the notion of a universal medium referred to as the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-aether').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-aether').style.display='none'">aether</span> and whether we can have the same frame swapping when it comes to light traveling in two different frames of reference, as we did in this section.

<h2 id="TheAether_header">The Aether</h2>
<div id="ch1_4_content">
In the theory electromagnetism from the late 1800s, it was believed that light was a wave and, therefore, would need a medium that filled the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-vacuum').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-vacuum').style.display='none'">vacuum</span> of space for it to travel through, called "the luminiferous <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-aether').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-aether').style.display='none'">aether</span>", and that light traveled at a constant speed relative to this <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-aether').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-aether').style.display='none'">aether</span>, like how the rats in the previous section moved at a constant speed relative to the medium of the treadmill's platform.
It was from the theory of electromagnetism and the experiments performed from it, that showed that light should have a constant speed, atleast relative to this aether, but it was yet to be known that light would actually have a constant speed relative to all things.
If the aether existed, the Earth would be moving through it, illustrated in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: Aether','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: Aether}</span>).

</figure>
So, an experimental setup by Michelson and Morley, shown in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: Michelson_morley','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: Michelson_morley}</span>), called an interferometer, was devised to measure Earth's movement through the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-aether').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-aether').style.display='none'">aether</span> \cite{EtherExperiment}, by measuring how it affected the return times of light emitted in different directions, as observed in Earth's <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-Reference-frame').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-Reference-frame').style.display='none'">reference frame</span>.
It did this by splitting a single light beam into two perpendicular paths that are then reflected back to be recombined and sent toward a light detector.
By rotating a platform that the setup is on, the two light paths could be aligned, one parallel and the other perpendicular to the Earth's motion through the presumed <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-aether').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-aether').style.display='none'">aether</span>.
They reasoned that if the speed of light was constant with respect to the proposed <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-aether').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-aether').style.display='none'">aether</span>, just like in the rat experiment from the previous section, the split light beams would recombine at different times.
From the previous section's system of rats on a treadmill, we can see that the treadmill's platform is analogous to the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-aether').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-aether').style.display='none'">aether</span>, and the rats are analogous to the light.
Both have the room where these experiments are done as the other inertial reference frame.

<figcaption>&nbsp;<b>Experiment to detect the aether.</b> A diagram showing the Michelson-Morley experiment, we can take the part of the paths between the beam splitter and two mirrors to be analogous to the case of the paths in the previous section of the rat and treadmill system.</figcaption>
</figure>
However, when Michelson and Morley performed the experiment, they found no difference in travel time to the detector for both paths, indicating that there was no difference in the speed of light in any direction in Earth's <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-Reference-frame').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-Reference-frame').style.display='none'">reference frame</span>.
Hence, light's speed is not dependent on the supposed <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-aether').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-aether').style.display='none'">aether</span>.
This null result seriously discredited the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-aether').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-aether').style.display='none'">aether</span> theories.
It ultimately led to the proposal by Einstein in 1905 that the speed of light (in a <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-vacuum').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-vacuum').style.display='none'">vacuum</span>) is a universal constant and is independent of the motion of the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='none'">observer</span> or source.
To allow for us to have this universal speed of light (in a <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-vacuum').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-vacuum').style.display='none'">vacuum</span>), it will require us to change our ideas of how time and positions are perceived by different <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='none'">observer</span>s.
</div> <!-- close section-->
<h2 id="SpeedofLight_header">Speed of Light</h2>
<div id="ch1_5_content">
The experiments within a vaccum, showed light does not just travel at a constant velocity relative to the proposed medium (the aether), and instead travels at a constant velocity regardless of the motion of the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-Reference-frame').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-Reference-frame').style.display='none'">reference frame</span>.
The observed speed of light is independent of how fast the source and receiver of that light are moving in the frame, as shown with a moving truck's headlights in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: truck torch','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: truck torch}</span>).
Light does move slower in objects such as glass, but this is due to the interactions between the light and the material, impeding the movement of light.
Light itself moves extremely fast compared to any other everyday speeds we are used to (roughly 300 000 000 meters per second; it can travel the world's diameter in the blink of an eye).
This is why we do not notice any delay in the light arrriving from the things we see in everyday life, and we assume everything to be located where we are currently seeing it, though we should remember that there is this delay.
For example, the light we currently see from the sun was emitted eight minutes ago for it to reach us now, and the further an object is located from us, the further back in time we are currently seeing it because of this delay.
When we look at the same truck setup as in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: truck cannonball','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: truck cannonball}</span>), but now have it in a <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-vacuum').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-vacuum').style.display='none'">vacuum</span>, where the cannon firing a cannonball is swapped for headlights emitting light, we will find the same speed of light when measured relative to the truck or the road, but how can this be true?

<figcaption>&nbsp;<b>Emitted light in different frames.</b> A diagram, showing light emitted from a truck in two different <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-Reference-frame').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-Reference-frame').style.display='none'">reference frame</span>s, with the emitted light having the same speed in each frame, though with different frequencies and energies due to the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-doppler-effect').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-doppler-effect').style.display='none'">Doppler effect</span>, which will be explained later.</figcaption>
</figure>
For this to be true, we need a new way of thinking about velocity addition.
This is because the velocities of objects must be added in a way that is consistent with the requirement that the speed of light is constant but also gives the approximate classical addition at speeds of objects at much less than the speed of light, like how we observed in the situation with the cannon and truck, shown in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: truck cannonball','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: truck cannonball}</span>).
Since the speed of the light depends only on the units of time and positions, the only way to correct for this is to have the measured positions and times of objects <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-transform').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-transform').style.display='none'">transform</span> differently when swapping between <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-Reference-frame').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-Reference-frame').style.display='none'">reference frame</span>s than the classical way.
This is what we will talk about next.
For the curious, it was the \href{https://scienceready.com.au/pages/determination-of-speed-of-light}{experiment by Ole RÃ¸mer} that showed that light traveled at a finite speed rather than being instantaneously emitted and received.

Consider a simple clock, as shown in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: truck clock','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: truck clock}</span>), made of a light pulse moving back and forth vertically between two mirrors on a moving truck, one on the truck's floor and the other on the roof directly above it.
Each tick of the clock is defined as the time it takes for the light to travel from one mirror to the other and back.
For an <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='none'">observer</span> in the truck, they will see the light go straight up and down between the mirrors, but an <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='none'">observer</span> stationary relative to the road will see not just the light traveling up and down but also with the direction of the truck to allow it to travel back and forth between the mirrors.
<figure id="fig: truck clock">
<img src="../topics/special-relativity/Latex/images/svg/lorry_clock.svg" style="width:100%; height:auto;" loading="lazy">
<figcaption>&nbsp;<b>Light clock on a truck.</b> A diagram, showing a clock consisting of light being reflected between the floor and roof of a truck to keep time, in the truck's frame (top), and in the road's frame with the truck moving (bottom).</figcaption>
</figure>
Given that the distance traveled by the light in the frame with the truck moving is longer, and from the previous sections we know that the speed of light is the same for both reference frames, to keep the speed of light invariant: the clock itself must tick slower in moving objects.
How much slower the time is passing in the moving truck relative to the road observer can be solved using the ratio of the lengths of the paths in each frame as shown in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: truck clock','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: truck clock}</span>), as this is the same ratio as the time between the ticks.
Importantly, this time dilation phenomenon isn't limited to light clocks; it applies universally to all types of clocks.
If you were to play a movie on the truck, it would take a longer time for it to play through from start to finish for an observer watching it from the road's <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-Reference-frame').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-Reference-frame').style.display='none'">reference frame</span>.
An observer on the road and in the truck experience time at different rates.
This is not just an illusion, it is physical reality.
The closer the truck goes to the speed of light, the more significant the difference in how fast the road frame's time flows relative to the truck frame's time.
This can be seen as an increasingly longer horizontal stretch in the path taken for the light from the perspective of someone standing still on the road, with the time between each tick approaching infinity as the speed of the truck approaches the speed of light.
You may ask about the possibility that the distance between the floor and roof of the truck becoming smaller the faster the truck is moving relative to the road, to allow for the light clock to tick at the same speed, and to get rid of the need for the time dilation, but that would actually lead to contradictions which will be shown later in figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: width contraction','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: width contraction}</span>).
Now, if we instead had two trucks moving at the same speed relative to the road but in opposite directions.
Each truck would see its light moving vertically up and down with the other truck's light moving a longer diagonal path.
Hence, each truck perceives the other truck's clock ticking slower.
An observer in the road's reference frame would see both trucks move at the same speed and, hence, their diagonal paths having the same length, giving the same passage of time between ticks for both trucks.
That is, The slowing of time of moving objects is the same regardless of its relative direction of motion, only the relative speed changes the travelled distance of the ticking light.
This concept is confusing and difficult to visualize, but it will get easier with practice.
For now, though, we will continue building up the concepts of special relativity.

<h3 id="Simultaneity_header">Simultaneity</h3>

Imagine a truck in its <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-proper-frame').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-proper-frame').style.display='none'">rest frame</span>, with a light bulb in the middle and mirrors on the front and back walls.
If the light bulb gives off a pulse of light, the light will travel from the center of the truck to reach the mirrors <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='none'">simultaneously</span> and back to reach the light bulb also <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='none'">simultaneously</span>.
An <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='none'">observer</span> on the road watching the truck drive past will see the light bulb <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='none'">simultaneously</span> emit light in both directions and <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='none'">simultaneously</span> return to the bulb again.
However, the light reflects off each wall's mirrors at different times in the road's frame to do this, as shown in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: truck simultaneity','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: truck simultaneity}</span>).
This is because the speed of light is the same for both directions, but the truck is moving, meaning the back of the truck is moving towards where the bulb was when the light pulse was emitted, making the distance traveled shorter.
The light travels a longer distance to the front wall due to the wall moving away from where it was emitted.
Because of this, the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='none'">observer</span> on the road will see the light hit the mirrors at different times.

</figure>
Consequently, times of <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-event').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-event').style.display='none'">event</span>s, such as when the light reaches either mirror, are different for <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='none'">observer</span>s in different <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-Reference-frame').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-Reference-frame').style.display='none'">reference frame</span>s.
There is no one true order of <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-event').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-event').style.display='none'">event</span>s.
For example, an <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='none'">observer</span> in a faster-moving vehicle moving in the opposite direction would see the light reach the front wall first.
However, for all <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='none'">observer</span>s, the light will return to the central light bulb <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='none'">simultaneously</span>.
If two <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-event').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-event').style.display='none'">event</span>s happen in the same position <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='none'">simultaneously</span>, then this happens <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='none'">simultaneously</span> in all frames of reference.
This means the light returns to the center of the light bulb <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='none'">simultaneously</span> in each frame.
A note here is that we are talking about when the events <b>actually</b> happen in each frame and not when the light from these events reaches the observer, which is later due to the time it takes the light from an event to travel to the observer for them to see it.
Also, I have left out any mention of <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-length-contraction').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-length-contraction').style.display='none'">length contraction</span> of the truck, which will be introduced in the next section, and why it needs to be equal in both directions from the lightbulb for the light to <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='none'">simultaneously</span> return to the light bulb.

Consider a truck, in its <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-proper-frame').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-proper-frame').style.display='none'">rest frame</span> carrying a square container.
If a light bulb at the square container's center emits light in the two horizontal directions and the two vertical directions it will bounce off the mirrored sides of the truck and return to the center <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='none'">simultaneously</span>.
We require that in the moving frame, they also all return to the center <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='none'">simultaneously</span>, as multiple <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-event').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-event').style.display='none'">event</span>s that happen at a single point <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='none'">simultaneously</span> in one frame, must happen <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='none'">simultaneously</span> in all other frames.
The light reflects off the walls at different locations, so the order of reflections in time will depend upon the relative observer, as described in the previous section.
The time between the light being emitted and absorbed from the light bulb is the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-time-dilation').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-time-dilation').style.display='none'">dilated time</span>, that was described in section (\ref{Subsect: Time Dilation}).
To achieve this <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='none'">simultaneity</span> in the return of the light to the bulb, the total length of the path of light in each of the four directions must be the same, as lights speed is the same in all directions.
We can work out the length of the up and downward path from the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-time-dilation').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-time-dilation').style.display='none'">time dilation</span> section (\ref{Subsect: Time Dilation}), and this is the length the path needs to be in the horizontal directions as well.
The paths can only have this length if the truck is contracted in the direction of its motion, to allow for the light to be relected from the walls at the required positions for these path lengths.
The amount of contraction is same in both directions.
The exact amount of the contraction can be worked geometrically, and it turns out that the ratio of the increase in the amount of time that passes before the light is reabsorbed is inversely proportional to the amount the truck is contracted in the direction of its movement.
That is, if in a moving frame the time is dilated so that the light clock takes twice as long between ticks, then the length of the moving lorry becomes half of its length when at rest.
This is shown in the following figure.
<figure id="fig: full truck transform">

In the second frame with the truck now moving (bottom), we see the truck's length contracted to allow all paths to be the same length.</figcaption>
</figure>
We now know that moving objects must shrink in the direction they move to allow for a consistent speed of light in each frame.
But this srinking is not noticeable when objects move much slower than light speed.
If you are unsatisfied with this, the next section will reason the need for length contraction in another way using three accelerating cars.
But first we will look at the reason we did not consider any change in sizes of moving objects in the directions perpendicular to an object's movement.
If we look at the possibility that a moving object contracts in the direction perpendicular to the direction of its movement, we find out that this leads to contradictions, as shown in figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: width contraction','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: width contraction}</span>).
As it allows for the possibility that a moving objects size in the perpendicular direction is smaller than a container when being observed in a containers rest frame but is bigger than its container in the object's frame.
Which is impossible as this would break the container just becuase you decided to viewed the object from a different reference frame.

<figcaption>&nbsp;<b>Paradox of height and width contraction.</b> A diagram showing why there must not be a contraction in the perpendicular direction to the frame's relative motion. The top Figure shows a ball and cannon at rest. The bottom figures show the cannon ball being fired in the frame of the cannon (left), where the moving ball has a contracted width, and (right) in the frame of the ball, where the canon is now moving and has a contract width, with the ball at rest being the same size. Both frames would contradict each other if there was a change in the width of moving objects, as the walls of the cannon and the surface of the ball would overlap in one frame and have a gap between them in the other. So, we require no size change perpendicular to the object's movement.</figcaption>
</figure>
In the previous section we had in the frame with the truck moving, that the emitted light reaches the top and bottom of the square container at the same time.
But the times it reachs the left and right walls are non-simulataneous, and it is this difference in timings that allows the truck to contract in the direction of movement without the contradictions that are present when we look at the possibility of contraction in the perpendicular direction to the movement.

Following this acceleration period, the cars have maintained equal spacing relative to both the car observers and the observer on the road.
As for all <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='none'">observer</span>s, the light reached the front and back cars at the same time.
Now, suppose we do this a second time, with the middle car releasing another pulse.
In this case, we have in the frame of the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='none'">observer</span>s in the cars: again, with the front and back drivers receiving the pulses simultaneously, meaning that they will start accelerating simultaneously.
After the acceleration has finished, the distances between the cars will be the same for the car observers.
But for the road <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='none'">observer</span>, they see the back car receive the signal first, as that car is moving towards the point where the light pulse was emitted, and the front car is moving away from it.
This would mean the back car would start accelerating first to get to the final constant velocity and get closer to the front car before the front car begins to accelerate to that same final speed that the back car had already reached.
This results in the cars being closer together after the acceleration.
The <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='none'">observer</span>s in the car and the road <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='none'">observer</span> disagree with what the distances between the cars are.
This contraction of length between cars, in the road's frame in which the cars are moving, is called Lorentz <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-length-contraction').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-length-contraction').style.display='none'">length contraction</span>, which means that objects that are moving faster become shorter, and the distances between the objects also become shorter.

<h2 id="DopplerEffect_header">Doppler Effect</h2>
<div id="ch1_7_content">
If we have a light source at rest, emitting circular pulses of light with equal times between each pulse, we will have concentric circular pulses in this frame.
But, if we move to a frame where the source is now moving to the right, each circular pulse is emitted from a different position.
Due to the source moving, each pulse will be emitted closer to the right-hand side of the previous pulses, creating a bunching up of the pulses (increase in frequency) in the direction of movement and a spreading out (decrease in frequency) of the pulses in the opposite direction.
This also happens in the classical version of the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-doppler-effect').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-doppler-effect').style.display='none'">Doppler effect</span>.
For example, you will notice that an ambulance or police car sounds different when driving towards or away from you due to the bunching up and spreading out of the sound waves in the direction and opposite direction of the moving vehicle.
However, in special relativity, we also must take the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-time-dilation').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-time-dilation').style.display='none'">time dilation</span> of the pulses into account, as there will be a longer time between each subsequential pulse.
This is due to objects moving relative to an observer and therefore having their perceived time moving more slowly.
This is called the second order Doppler effect most notably seen in optical clocks.
This has a decreasing effect on the frequency in all directions.
However, directly in the direction of movement of the source, this is outweighed by the frequency increase from the previous bunching-up effect.
Since the energy of the light is proportional to the frequency, it is also increased in the direction of motion of the source due to the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-doppler-effect').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-doppler-effect').style.display='none'">Doppler effect</span>s and decreased in the opposite direction.

From the diagrams, you can see how light's direction of propagation is changed when emitted or absorbed by a moving source relative to its <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-proper-frame').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-proper-frame').style.display='none'">rest frame</span>, this is called relativistic aberration. The faster the source is moving, the more the direction of each part of the light pulse is changed/aberrated.
If the speed of a source was to approach the speed of light, all emitted light's propagation direction would approach the direction of movement of the source.
If the source could theoretically reach the speed of light, all light would be emitted in the direction of the source but also move at the same speed.
That is, the source would move with the emitted light, and it would not leave the vicinity of the source.
The rate at which it emits the light would also tend to zero.
If a photon theoretically had mass and its influence of the gravitational force moved at the speed of light, then we would not be able to feel any gravitational effects from this theoretical photon with mass outside its vicinity.
This is due to all its gravitational field being propagated in the direction of its movement and at the same speed as the photon.
Another note is that in astrophysics, it must be taken into account that the Earth's view of the universe is distorted by <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-aberration').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-aberration').style.display='none'">aberration</span> when looking through telescopes, with the aberrational effect depending on where it is in its rotation around the sun.

Then in a second frame with the source now moving, the doppler effect has the spherical pulse's wavelength bunched up in the direction of movement (giving a change in the color of the light), with the aberrational effect also giving the angular spread of the light at a higher concentration in the direction of the movement of the source, as shown in figures (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: Relativistic Beaming','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: Relativistic Beaming}</span>).

<br>For astrophysics, we need to consider this beaming when looking at distant stars that are moving relative to us so that we can accurately calculate their brightness and the spectrum of light that they are emitting, along with some other things.
We also need to consider that the position we are currently seeing the stars in is their past position due to the delay in light traveling to us on Earth, which is referred to as the retarded position.
We will talk about this next.

We can make a vector field plot, which is a plot of arrows that shows the position and direction of light in space.
So if we have a source in its rest frame that continually emits pulses of light with a constant time between each pulse, we get what is shown in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: vector field of light source rest frame','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: vector field of light source rest frame}</span>).
If we wanted to know what this light vector field looked like in a frame with the source moving, we would need to take into account that the position the source emitted each pulse from is its past position (retarded position).
We also have the dilated time between pulses in this moving frame, so using these and the beaming effect from the previous section we get the light's vector field as shown in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: vector field of light source primed frame','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: vector field of light source primed frame}</span>).
From this, we can work out the distribution and, hence, the concentration of the light for any moving source relative to when it is at rest.
If you look closely at the diagrams, you will see the aberrated rings of all the pulses, all with different points from which they were emitted, with them being more compact in the direction of the source's movement.

<br>In particle physics, the photon is the particle that composes light.
It is the carrier of the electromagnetic force between charges.
So how the light's propagation transforms when swapping between frames is necessary to understand electromagnetism, and how the magnetic field comes about for non stationary sources.
The diagram of the moving source shows you where the source and light currently are.
But, if you were an observer at a particular position in the vector field, you would see the source at its retarded position and not where it currently is, as the light has to travel to you before you see it.
This will be used in the next section to show that you can perceive things moving faster than light, even if they are not.

We looked at how velocities at the speed of light change between different frames of reference, that is, how their directions of propagation are rotated (aberrated).
However, for objects moving at velocities slower than that of light, its speed will change in addition to to the direction being transformed when swaping between frames.
This is due to us needing the relativistic transform to tend towards the classical <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-transform').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-transform').style.display='none'">transform</span> as we look at smaller and smaller speeds of objects.
To understand the general velocity <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-transform').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-transform').style.display='none'">transformation</span>, some mathematical detail is needed, so we will need to brush over this for now, and instead look at how the perceived speeds of objects can be more than that of light, even if they are moving slower.
<h3 id="PerceivedvsActualSpeed_header">Perceived vs Actual Speed</h3>

Imagine that a ball one light year away (the distance it takes light to travel in a year) is fired directly towards you, as shown in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: perceived vs actual speed','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: perceived vs actual speed}</span>).
It will take one year for the first light from when the ball starts moving to reach you.
If the ball moves at three-quarters of the speed of light, it will hit you in four-thirds of a year (a year and four months) after it is fired.
The last light from the ball will reach you just as the ball hits you.
As you perceive it, the time between the first and last light from the moving ball is four months.
During those four months, you will see the ball start at its initial position and travel a distance of one light-year.
So, to you, the ball appears to have been moving three times faster than light.
This is just how it appears to the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='none'">observer</span> due to the delay in the light signal, giving the latency in how the system is observed.

This shows how important it is to consider the delay in the light from objects when observing relativistic systems.
This view is called the delayed/retarded view, meaning what we see now are objects in their past positions, and the further things are from us, the further into the past we are currently seeing them.

<h2 id="Summary_header">Summary</h2>
<div id="ch1_12_content">
A key early concept was that light traveled through a medium called the luminiferous aether.
The Michelson-Morley experiment attempted to measure Earth's motion relative to this aether.
Surprisingly, no difference was found in the speed of light regardless of direction through this proposed aether.
This conflicted with the intuitive addition of velocities, discredited the aether theory, and led Einstein to propose light's constant speed in all inertial frames of reference as a fundamental principle.
Special relativity emerged from this insight that light's speed in a vacuum is constant for all observers, regardless of the light source's speed relative to each observer.
This required rethinking the concepts of time intervals and distances between points to accommodate light's fixed speed.
This led to the requirement that a clock moving relative to an observer ticks slower from the observer's perspective while also being contracted in the direction of its motion.
This was shown in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: truck clock','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: truck clock}</span>) and Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: full truck transform','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: full truck transform}</span>).
The faster an object moves relative to an observer, the more its length contracts and its time dilates to the observer.
It also led to the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='none'">simultaneity</span> of events not being absolute.
For example, light emitted from the middle of a moving truck reaches the front and back walls simultaneously for an observer at rest in the truck.
But an observer standing still on the road sees the light hit both walls at different times, as shown in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: truck simultaneity','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: truck simultaneity}</span>).
There is no universal "now" at a distance-observers relate times of events differently.
It is only events that happen simultaneously at the same location that happen simultaneously in all frames of reference.
Classical physics is verified by our day to day experience, though this does not reflect the full reality, as relativistic effects only become readily noticeable at speeds close to that of light.
With the speed of light being 300 million meters per second, astronomically faster than what occurs in our daily experience.
When it comes to velocities, they combine differently than in classical physics.
However, we must ensure that the transforms reduce to the intuitive addition of velocities of classical physics at low speeds while accommodating light's constant rate in all frames of reference.
This leads to initially bizarre outcomes such as <b>apparent</b> faster-than-light motion emerging from how relativistic optical effects play out across distances, which is due to the delay in light signals from objects at a distance.
Nevertheless, special relativity gives a truer, more accurate picture of reality.
Due to space-time effects on wave propagation, we also have seen that the emitted light's frequencies shift (doppler effect) for a moving source, and that light is concentrated in the direction of the source's motion (aberrational effect).
Together, both intensely focus light in the direction of rapidly moving objects, giving relativistic beaming.
These effects will all be explained more fully with math in the coming chapters, along with other effects that require the math to fully understand, as well as new energy, mass, and momentum conservation laws.
We will derive everything step by step, starting with the transformation of positions and times between reference frames.

Now that we have learned about the concepts of special relativity, we can use them and let the mathematics begin.
Starting with classical relativity, which will give us an understanding of how to <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-transform').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-transform').style.display='none'">transform</span> coordinates between <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-Reference-frame').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-Reference-frame').style.display='none'">reference frame</span>s.
This will give us something to compare special relativity to later, and help with our intuition.
What we learn here will be directly used in all of the following chapters, to derive more of the foundational concepts of the theory.
As everything else is all built upon this chapter, which is about how the positions and times are transformed between two inertial frames to allow the speed of light to stay constant.
In this chapter, we will start with how swapping between two inertial frames works classically.
Then using the two assumed facts, the postulates, that are used as the basis of reasoning for special relativity, we will find out how to swap between frames in special relativity, by following the train of thought that we did in the previous conceptual chapter.
By first deriving the time dilation, and length contraction equations in order to then find the full transform of the space and time coordinates between two inertial frames.
We will come across a very useful quantity which we will denote with a \({\gamma}\), this quantity will be used throughout this book to simplify equations.
After this, we will look at the transform for infinitesimal changes in distances and use this to derive how velocities and accelerations change when swapping between two inertial frames.
By the end of this chapter, you will understand the coordinate transforms conceptually and mathematically when swapping between two frames, and how to derive the velocity and acceleration transforms.

It was based on two assumptions, which are that <b>in each frame, you would observe the following:</b>
\begin{itemize}
<li>The distance between objects is the same.</li>
<li>Time flows at the same rate, giving the same time for all events.</li>
\end{itemize}
Before special relativity, it was assumed that distances between two points were the same for all <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='none'">observer</span>s.
That is, the first <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='none'">observer</span> would see a stick and measure it to be the same length as another <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='none'">observer</span> who is moving relative to the first.
The other assumption is that the flow of time is the same for everyone.
That is, clocks move at the same rate for each <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='none'">observer</span> and if, say, a particle was to emit light at a particular time, this light would be emitted at the same time for all <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='none'">observer</span>s.
For classical relativity, if we have the positions and times of a particle's motion relative to one observer in their frame, and we want to find the motion of the particle relative to a second observer who is moving at constant velocity relative to the first.
We need to know how to transform these into this second observer's frame.
That is, if we have how one <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='none'">observer</span> would describe the coordinates of a particle over time relative to them and we want to now know the coordinates of the particle with respect to the other <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='none'">observer</span>, we need to know how the transformation of coordinates works.
So let us see how the mathematics works for the classical coordinate system transform between two inertial observers frames, by looking at the coordinates of an event in an initial reference frame with a second inertial frame's coordinate axis moving relative to the initial frame's, illustrated in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: simple Galilean transform derivation','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: simple Galilean transform derivation}</span>):

<figcaption>&nbsp;<b>An event in initial frame with a primed frame's axis moving relative to its axis.</b>	This shows an initial frame with its associated \(x,y,z\)-coordinate system at rest in this frame, with origin \({O}\). There is also an \(x',y',z'\)-coordinate system with origin \({O'}\) associated with the "primed" frame, at position \({\vec{OO'}}=(0,0,{v}{t})\) in the initial frame, where \({v}\) is the speed of the primed frame in the z-direction relative to the initial frame, and \({t}\) is the time in the initial frames. An event \({\vec{E}}\) in this initial frame is described by a set of spatial and time coordinates \({\mathbf{r}} = ({x},{y},{z})\) and \({t}\). We choose the time to be zero in both frames when both axes overlapped, so that \({t}\) is also the time from when they overlapped. We also show \({\vec{O'E}}\) which represents the vector from the primed axis origin to the event in the initial frame.</figcaption>
</figure>
As shown in the diagram, we are in the initial frame with origin \({O}\) defined by coordinates \((0,0,0)\) and the primed frame is moving in the z-direction at velocity \({v}\) such that the position of the primed origin relative to the initial frame's axis is
<div class="math">
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
\vec{OO{'}} = (0,0,{v}{t})
\end{equation}
</div>

at time \({t}\) from when the origins overlapped.
If there is an <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-event').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-event').style.display='none'">event</span> at position
<div class="math">
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{r} = ({x},{y},{z})
\end{equation}
</div>
</div>
the event is described by
<div class="math">
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
\vec{E} = ({x},{y},{z},{t})
\end{equation}
</div>
</div>
then in the primed frame, we will have the event described by the primed coordinates that we want to transform into, as
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
\vec{E{'}} = ({x{'}},{y{'}},{z{'}},t{'})
\end{equation}
</div>
To swap into the primed frame's coordinates, we need to recall from the previous assumptions that distances and times are conserved, and therefore the length and directions of all the vectors between \({O}\), \({O^{'}}\) and \({E}\) are the same in each frame, and time flows at the same rate (\({t'} = {t}\)), from this knowledge and Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: simple Galilean transform derivation','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: simple Galilean transform derivation}</span>) we have the event's coordinates described in the primed frame by its coordinate axis as
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
{\mathbf{r}{'}} = ({x{'}},{y{'}},{z{'}}) = \mathbf{r}-\vec{OO{'}} = ({x},{y},{z}-{v}{t})

\end{equation}
</div>
This gives us the full description of the position and time <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-transform').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-transform').style.display='none'">transform</span> for an <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-event').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-event').style.display='none'">event</span> as
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
\bbox[#fff9cf, 10px, border-radius: 10px; border: 3px solid black]{
\begin{aligned}
& {x{'}} = {x}        \\
& {y{'}} = {y}        \\
& {z{'}} = {z}-{v}{t} \\
\text{at time \ \ \ }  \\
& {t{'}}= {t}
\end{aligned}
}

\end{equation}
</div>
These are the equations that define classical relativity, we can compare this to the equations of the coordinate transforms in special relativity later. They define the event's position relative to whichever frame that we are in's axis. The special relativistic equations later will look similar to these, but with an extra factor in the z-component and with the time will no longer be consistent in both frames.
We can also write the initial frame's event coordinates in terms of the primed coordinates, by rearranging the transformation equations giving the inverse transform as
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
& {x} = {x{'}}             \\
& {y} = {y{'}}             \\
& {z} = {z{'}} + {v}{t{'}} \\
\text{at time \ \ \ }       \\
& {t} = {t{'}}
\end{aligned}

\end{equation}
</div>
So the inverse transformation, going from <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-Primed-Frame').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-Primed-Frame').style.display='none'">primed frame</span> to original is just a matter of swapping all primed and initial coordinates and changing the sign on the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-frame-velocity').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-frame-velocity').style.display='none'">frame velocity</span>
This can be seen at time \({t} = 0\) when we have the frame's origins overlapping and there is a symmetry from here, as we have the freedom to choose either frame to be the original, as no frame is particularly special and depending which one you pick the relative velocity is either \({v}\) or-\({v}\). We will have the same rules in special relativity later on when we want to get the inverse transform.
You might have noticed that the direction of the second frame is in the upward z-direction instead of being to the right in the case of the truck diagrams from the previous chapter, this is to help us when we use spherical polar coordinates later and to help see the symmetries. But that is a couple of chapters away, for now we will look at the assumptions of special relativity and their consequences, which we will then apply to the same notion of an event that we have in the Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: simple Galilean transform derivation','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: simple Galilean transform derivation}</span>).

<h2 id="PostulatesofSpecialRelativity_header">Postulates of Special Relativity</h2>
<div id="ch2_2_content">
For classical relativity, we started with two assumptions. It turns out that these assumptions need to be thrown away, as they contradict the experimental evidence that the speed of light is constant for every observer and frame. We replace them with two new assumptions, called the <b>postulates of special relativity:</b>
\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{enumerate}
<li>The speed of light in a <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-vacuum').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-vacuum').style.display='none'">vacuum</span> is the same in all inertial/non-accelerating frames of reference.</li>
<li>The laws of physics and outcome of experiments are the same in all <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-Inertial-reference-frame').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-Inertial-reference-frame').style.display='none'">inertial frames of reference</span>. If an observer in an inertial reference frame carries out an experiment, they would find the same result if they had carried it out within a different inertial frame instead.</li>
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}
The first postulate here will be the most important to us in deriving the transform equations of special relativity and will be used to show how time is dilated/slowed down for moving objects. The second postulate has a consequence that if events happen simultaneously at an overlapping position in one frame, then they will also happen simultaneously in an overlapping position in any other inertial frame.
We will now use these assumptions with the concept of a light clock to show the effect of length contraction.
</div> <!-- close section-->
<h2 id="TimeDilation_header">Time Dilation</h2>
<div id="ch2_3_content">
Time passes more slowly for things moving relative to you, this is called time dilation.
To explain why it happens we will use the simple concept of a light clock.
It consists of light bouncing between two mirrors.
It keeps time by measuring when light returns to the first mirror, counting it as one tick of its clock, as shown in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: light clock','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: light clock}</span>).

</figure>
<br>The light in the clock, takes a time \({\Delta\tau}\) in the clock's rest frame to make the return journey.
We can see from Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: light clock rest frame','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: light clock rest frame}</span>) that in the rest frame, the distance the light travels to the mirror and back in this time is
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
2{L} = {c}{\Delta\tau}.
\end{equation}
</div>
The distance the mirrors move during this return journey in the moving frame is
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
{u}{\Delta t{'}} =-{v} {\Delta t{'}},
\end{equation}
</div>
where \({\Delta t{'}}\) is the time it took light to return in the moving frame and \({u}\) is the speed of the light clock, which is in the opposite direction of the movement of the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-Primed-Frame').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-Primed-Frame').style.display='none'">primed frame</span> relative to the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-proper-frame').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-proper-frame').style.display='none'">rest frame</span>, that is \({u} =-{v}\).
The distance light travels in this time is
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
{c}{\Delta t{'}}
\end{equation}
</div>
This is the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle formed by \({u}{\Delta t{'}}=-{v}{\Delta t{'}}\) and \(2{L}\), so we have the square of the hypotenuse equal to the square of the other two lengths:
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
{c}^2 {\Delta t{'}}^2 = {v}^2 {\Delta t{'}}^2 + {c}^2{\Delta\tau}^2
\end{equation}
</div>
rearranging to find the time it took in the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-Primed-Frame').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-Primed-Frame').style.display='none'">primed frame</span> relative to the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-proper-frame').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-proper-frame').style.display='none'">rest frame</span>, we find
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
{\Delta t{'}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{{v}^2}{{c}^2}}} {\Delta\tau} = {\gamma} {\Delta\tau}
\end{equation}
</div>
with
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
{\gamma} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{{v}^2}{{c}^2}}}.
\end{equation}
</div>
This factor, \({\gamma}\), is used throughout special relativity to simplify equations.
We can see from the diagram and the equations, that the time for the return journey in the frame with the clock moving is longer relative to its rest frame,
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
{\Delta t{'}} \geq {\Delta\tau}
\end{equation}
</div>
We take this outcome as the time taken between two <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-event').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-event').style.display='none'">event</span>s at the same position in the moving frame takes longer than in the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-proper-frame').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-proper-frame').style.display='none'">rest frame</span> of the clock, due to the longer distance light must travel at the same speed.
Hence systems that are moving seem to have there time flowing slower.
One example of this, is that unstable particles that are moving faster have longer livespans before they decay.
</div> <!-- close section-->
<h2 id="LengthContraction_header">Length Contraction</h2>
<div id="ch2_4_content">
An object's size gets smaller in the direction of movement compared to when it is at rest, this is called length contraction.
To explain why it happens we will add a second perpendicular light path to previous section's experimental setup.
So there is now light moving perpendicular as well as parallel the the primed frame's movement, as shown in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: length contraction math','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: length contraction math}</span>)

<br>If we have a system as described in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: length contraction math','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: length contraction math}</span>).
Then since the light returns simultaneously in the rest frame, we need the light to also return simultaneously in the second frame.
Multiple events that happen at a single point simultaneously in one frame, must happen simultaneously at a single point in all other frames.
This is to allow for the second postulate to hold true.
The time between the light being emitted and absorbed will be the dilated time that we worked out in the previous section.
This can be seen as the sideways light path in this and the light clock's setup from previous section is the same path.
In the moving frame, to achieve this simultaneity in the return of the light to the bulb, the length of the full path of light from the central bulb to the front mirror and back (\(2 {\Delta L^{'}} = {l^{'}_1} + {l^{'}_2}\)) must be the same as the perpendicular path, due to the speed of light being the same for both paths.
We can work out the length of the sideways paths from the time dilation section, \({c}{\Delta t^{'}}\), and this is the length the total path needs to be in the forward directions as well.
We will find that the paths can only have this length, if the distance between the bulb and the front mirror is contracted in the direction of movement.
Note that there can not be a contraction in the perpendicular direction to the movement due to the paradox explained in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: width contraction','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: width contraction}</span>).
In the moving frame, the pulse sent forward has a path length equal to the speed of light times the time taken for the path.
Which is also equal to the primed frame's distance between the bulb and mirror plus the distance the mirror has moved away from the point it was emitted in this time, that is
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
{l^{'}_1} = {c}{\Delta t^{'}_1} = {\Delta  L^{'}} + {u} {\Delta t^{'}_1}
\end{equation}
</div>
where \({u}\) is the speed that the front mirror is moving away from the point it was emitted, \({\Delta t^{'}_1}\) is the time taken to get to the mirror, and \({\Delta  L^{'}}\) is the distance between the bulb and the mirror in front in the primed frame.
After reaching the mirror, the light then must travel back to the bulb a distance
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
{l^{'}_2} = {c} {\Delta t^{'}_2} = {\Delta  L^{'}} - {u} {\Delta t^{'}_2}.
\end{equation}
</div>
Where \({\Delta t^{'}_2}\) is the time taken to return to the bulb from the front mirror, with the source moving twowards the reflected light.
Both of these give the two times as
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
{\Delta t^{'}_1} = \frac{\Delta  L'}{{c} - {u}}
\end{equation}
</div>
and
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
{\Delta t^{'}_2} = \frac{{\Delta  L^{'}}}{{c} + {u}}.
\end{equation}
</div>
Adding both these times together gives the total dilated time of return as
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
{\Delta t{'}} = {\Delta  L^{'}}(\frac{1}{{c} + {u}} + \frac{1}{{c} - {u}}) = \frac{\Delta  L^{'}}{c}\frac{2}{1- {u}^2/{c}^2} =  2{\gamma}^2 \frac{\Delta  L^{'}}{c}
\end{equation}
</div>
where we used \({u}=-{v}\) and then the \({\gamma}\) factor to simplfy equation.
Now from this and using the the time dilation equation, we have
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
{c}{\Delta t{'}} = {c}{\gamma} {\Delta t} = 2{\gamma} {\Delta L} = 2{\gamma}^2 {\Delta  L^{'}}
\end{equation}
</div>
Finally, this leads to the length from the bulb to the front mirror in the primed frame to be
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
{\Delta  L^{'}} = \frac{1}{{\gamma}}{\Delta  L}.
\end{equation}
</div>
This means that for a system moving relative to an observer, the distances for the system in the direction of movement are contracted compared to the rest frame of the object, that is
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
{\Delta  L^{'}} \leq {\Delta  L}.
\end{equation}
</div>
Objects and the distance between them are therefore shorter in a frame with them moving compared to in the rest frame of the objects.
With this knowledge and the last section, we can now derive the coordinate transform equations.

<h2 id="PositionandTimeTransformation_header">Position and Time Transformation</h2>

In the last two sections we have looked at the dilation between two different times at the same location and the contraction between two different positions at the same time, when we swap between frames.
Now we will use both these concepts to help us see how the combination of the time and the position coordinate, known as an event, transforms when we swap frames.
For the derivation of the coordinate transformation of an event between two inertial frames, we will be starting with the same diagram as we had in the classical relativity in Section (\ref{sect: Classical Relativity}) and apply what we have learned from the time dilation and length contraction sections so that we can be consistent with the postulates of special relativity.
This will allow us to derive the coordinate transformation equations, known as the Lorentz transformation.

These are just the position coordinates of the event in the primed frame.
The primed frame's axis and coordinates are moving relative to the initial frame, so from the previous length contraction section we would have the displacement between the primed axis origin and the event in the intial frame \(\vec{O'E}\), length contracted, in the \(z\)-direction, compared to the primed position coordinates in the primed frame \({\mathbf{r}{'}}\), that is

There is a symmetry between the frames because if we were originally in the primed frame we would have the initial frame moving instead at -\({v}\) in the z-direction relative to the primed frame and we could follow the above steps starting with this and the primed coordinate instead, and find the inverse <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-transform').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-transform').style.display='none'">transformation</span> is the same apart from it replaces each frame's coordinates with the other and has the negative of the previous frame velocity instead.

These are the equations that define special relativity, They allow us tyo find an event's position relative to whichever frame that we want to swap into's axis.
In the time <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-transform').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-transform').style.display='none'">transform</span> equation the \(\frac{{v}{z}}{{c}^2}\) term is the cause of the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='none'">simultaneity</span> of <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-event').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-event').style.display='none'">event</span>s at two different positions in one inertial frame no longer being <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='none'">simultaneous</span> in another inertial frame, and the \({\gamma}\) factor, is the term that causes the overall change in how fast time flows at a point relative to the initial frame.
In the spatial coordinate transform equations the the \({v}{t}\) factor is due to both axes' origins moving away from each other and the \({\gamma}\) factor is the cause of the change of lengths in the direction of the frame's movement.
We can see how points representing the coordinates in an initial frame look like in a primed frame of reference, by looking at Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: coordinate transform','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: coordinate transform}</span>).

<br>This diagram shows stationary points representing coordinates in the initial frame.
In the primed frame, these points are transformed to the position \({z{'}} = {\gamma} {z}\) and are now moving at speed \(-{v}\), they are transformed using the transformation equations to points that are more spread out in the primed frame, but the times they are located at each of these points are different, they have desynchronized times.
Therefore to find these points, which represent the coordinates in the initial frame, now in the primed frame at the synchronized time of \({t{'}} = 0\), we must propagate the points to that time, which ends up being \({z{'}} = \frac{{z}}{{\gamma}}\), as shown in figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: coordinate transform subfig_3','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: coordinate transform subfig_3}</span>).
This figure is to give you a little bit more intuition on how the coordinates and swapping between frames work.
We will later see a more natural interpretation of the coordinate transforms when we introduce the notion of retarded time in Chapter (\ref{ch: Observers Delayed Worldview}), which will give us another reason for why the time transformation is the way it is.
<h3 id="TransformswithSmallPrimedFrameVelocity_header">Transforms with Small Primed Frame Velocity</h3>
<div id="ch2_5_1_content">
If we have the primed frame velocity much smaller than the speed of light, (\(v \ll c\)), then we have \({v}/{c}\approx 0\) and therefore \(\gamma \approx 1\).
Hence we get back the previous classical transform equations
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
{t{'}} \approx t
\end{equation}
</div>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
z{'} \approx {z}-{v}{t}
\end{equation}
</div>
which is the expected result, as it agrees with the everyday observations we are used to seeing at these speeds.
That is, no noticeable difference in times on clocks or lengths of moving objects.
We can see when the \(\gamma\)-factor's influence starts to become significant from Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: Gamma Factor','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: Gamma Factor}</span>).

</figure>
As can be seen, it is not until around when the primed frame velocity is a third of the speed of light, that it significantly differs from being equal to 1.
This is a speed unattainable to us, the only thing we can bring up close to this speed is particles, and nothing humanmade is even a 1000th the speed of light.

<h3 id="SpaceandTimeIntervals_header">Space and Time Intervals</h3>
<div id="ch2_5_2_content">
To get the velocity transform equations we will first need the equations to transform the displacement between two positions and the interval between times, then take them in the limit as the changes go to zero.
That is, when we have infinitesimal changes of coordinates.
If we want to know how the displacement between two coordinates \({\vec{R}_1} = (x_1,y_1,z_1)\) and \({\vec{R}_2} = (x_2,y_2,z_2)\) transforms, we can take the difference of the transforms of both the coordinates as follows
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
& {x{'}}_2-{x{'}}_1 = x_2-x_1                                                                                         \\
& {y{'}}_2-{y{'}}_1 = y_2-y_1                                                                                         \\
& z{'}_2-z{'}_1 = {\gamma} ( z_2- {v} {t}_2)-{\gamma} ( z_1- {v} {t}_1)                                               \\
& {t{'}}_2-t{'}_1 = {\gamma} \bigg( {t}_2-\frac{v}{{c}^2} z_2 \bigg)-{\gamma} \bigg( {t}_1-\frac{v}{{c}^2} z_1 \bigg)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
</div>
rearranging and replacing the difference of the first and second of each coordinate with \({\Delta}{\vec{R}} = ({\Delta}x,{\Delta}y,{\Delta}z) = (x_2-x_1,y_2-y_1,z_2-z_1)\), giving the displacement transform as
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}

\begin{aligned}
& \Delta x{'} = {\Delta x}                                                   \\
& \Delta {y{'}} = {\Delta y}                                                 \\
& \Delta {z{'}} = {\gamma} ( {\Delta z}- {v} \Delta t)                       \\
& {\Delta t{'}} = {\gamma} \bigg( \Delta t-\frac{v}{{c}^2} {\Delta z} \bigg)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
</div>
This is the same form as the original coordinate transform equations.
From these equations, we can also get the differential quantities when we take infinitesimal changes, which give the same form again, as
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}

\begin{aligned}
& {dx{'}} = {dx}                                        \\
& {dy{'}} = {dy}                                        \\
& {dz{'}} = {\gamma} (dz- {v}dt)                        \\
& {dt{'}} = {\gamma} \bigg(dt-\frac{v}{{c}^2} dz \bigg)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
</div>
So when we make an infinitesimally small change in position and/or time within a frame, we know what the corresponding change is in a primed frame, we will use these to get the velocity transform equations.
As velocity at any instance is the infinitesimal change in position per infinitesimal change in time.
These will also be used later to find, invariant quantities, quantities that remain the same in each frame.
For example, the space-time interval and the energy-momentum relationship in Chapter (\ref{ch: Invariant Quantities}).

<h2 id="Velocity_header">Velocity</h2>
<div id="ch2_6_content">
The velocity at any instant is the infinitesimal change in position over the infinitesimal change in time \(\frac{d\vec{R}}{dt}\).
So using the infinitesimals from Equation <span class="ref_eq" onmouseover="copyContent('eq: Infintesmal interval of Coordinates','equation_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('equation_hover');">\eqref{eq: Infintesmal interval of Coordinates}</span>, we get the velocity in each direction as

& {{u}_{y}}^{'} = \frac{dy{'}}{dt{'}} = \frac{dy}{{\gamma} \bigg(dt-\frac{vdz}{{c}^2}\bigg) }                    \\
& {{u}_{z}}^{'} = \frac{dz{'}}{dt{'}} = \frac{{\gamma} (dz - {v}dt)}{{\gamma} \bigg(dt-\frac{vdz}{{c}^2}\bigg) }
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
</div>
now dividing the top and bottom of the fraction on the right hand side by \({dt}\) we can give the equations in their vector form as
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}

{{u}_{y}}                              \\
{\gamma} \left( {{u}_{z}}- {v} \right) \\
\end{pmatrix}
\\
& \text{at position \({\mathbf{r}{'}}\) and time \({t{'}}\) }
\end{aligned}
}

\end{equation}
</div>
This is used to find the velocity of anything in another frame at the corresponding primed position and time.
We will put this equation to work in a later section when we look at how the light emitted from a source particle has its velocity direction changed/aberrated and the effect this has on its intensity in all directions. Next, we will use this to get the acceleration transform.

</div>
Now, divide by \({dt{'}}\) as we did for the velocity in the previous section, and we get the acceleration transform as
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
\bbox[#fff9cf, 10px, border-radius: 10px; border: 3px solid black]{

\mathbf{a}{'} = \dfrac{1}{{\gamma}^2\left(1-\dfrac{v}{{c}^2} {{u}_{z}}\right)^3 }

\frac{1}{{\gamma}} {{a}_{z}}                                         \\
\end{pmatrix}
\\
\text{at position \({\mathbf{r}{'}}\) and time \({t{'}}\) }

}

\end{equation}
</div>
So if we know how a particle accelerates in one frame we will know its corresponding acceleration in another frame at the corresponding primed time and position.

<h2 id="Summary_header">Summary</h2>
<div id="ch2_8_content">
We derived the mathematics for the transformation of the spatial and time coordinates for classical relativity to help us understand the derivation of special relativity.
We then introduced the assumptions, known as the postulates of special relativity, which we use to derive how time slows down due to time dilation and lengths of moving objects get smaller due to length contraction.
This allowed us to derive the transformation equations, which in turn allowed us to calculate the velocity and acceleration transforms.
We were also introduced to \(\gamma\), which is a factor used throughout relativity to simplify equations.
From this chapter, we will now be able to transform from one frame into another, in special relativity.
If you have a system of particles in an initial frame and you want to transform their positions to a new frame, you need to first define where this initial axis' origin is.
You are free to choose where it is.
The primed frame's axis will overlap with this initial frame's axis at your chosen starting time, that is when you define the time as \({t}=0\) (the time of the overlap is also \({t{'}}=0\) in the primed frame).
You can now transform the positions into the primed frame.
These particles have these primed frame positions at the calculated primed frame times, these are defined in Equations <span class="ref_eq" onmouseover="copyContent('eq: Lorentz transformation','equation_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('equation_hover');">\eqref{eq: Lorentz transformation}</span>.
To transform the velocities and acceleration to these primed frame positions at the corresponding primed frame times, you can use equations <span class="ref_eq" onmouseover="copyContent('eq: acceleration transform','equation_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('equation_hover');">\eqref{eq: acceleration transform}</span> and <span class="ref_eq" onmouseover="copyContent('eq: velocity transform','equation_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('equation_hover');">\eqref{eq: velocity transform}</span>.
An easy mistake to make is to forget that \({t}\) and \({t{'}}\) are the times from the overlap of the frame origins, in their respective frames.
This chapter shows the foundations of special relativity, but there is still more to come.
Before we go further though, we will take a look at the delayed view of the world to an observer due to the delay in light from their surrounding.
This will help us understand why we need the time transformation to be the way it is.

Light travels extremely fast compared to other everyday speeds we are used to, roughly at 300,000,000 m/s.
In the blink of an eye, light could travel around the world twice.
We do not need to normally worry about the delay in the light signal, as the time to propagate the distances in our everyday world is extremely short, so the signal can be approximated as being instantaneous, ignoring the more complex modeling of the delayed signal.
But when it comes to particle physics or astronomy, we might be dealing with speeds close to that of light or huge distances.
For example, light has taken 152,000 years to travel from the Andromeda galaxy, so we are currently seeing this galaxy where it was and how it looked 152,000 years ago.
These past positions that we currently see are called the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-retarded-position').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-retarded-position').style.display='none'">retarded</span>/delayed view positions.
The topics in this chapter are not normally included in Special relativity texts.
But they are needed to get you a more full story and understanding of relativity.
They come with extra insights into the reason for why the coordinate transform equations have to be the way that they are.
As we will see when transforming retarded coordinates.
<h2 id="RelativisticObserversDelayedview_header">Relativistic Observers Delayed view</h2>
<div id="ch3_1_content">
When looking at moving objects we see them where they were in their past positions, due to the delay in the light signal from them.
So we will look at what the transform would be if we wanted to transform this delayed view position that is called the retarded coordinate, that consists of the retarded position and retarded time of this position.
Imagine that all coordinates act like a source of emmiting light.
Let us describe a coordinate emitting a photon to an <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='none'">observer</span> at the origin, showing the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-retarded-position').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-retarded-position').style.display='none'">retarded position</span> the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='none'">observer</span> sees the coordinate source at.

<br>As shown in the diagram, if we take the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-proper-frame').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-proper-frame').style.display='none'">rest frame</span> of an <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='none'">observer</span> and a source that emits a pulse of light from its position at \({\mathbf{r}}\) so that it is received by the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-observer').style.display='none'">observer</span> at the origin, at time \({t} = 0\).
The retarded time the pulse of light was emitted is \({{t}_{ret}} =-\frac{\|\mathbf{r}\|}{c}\), which is the negative of the time it took for light to propagate along \({\mathbf{r}}\) to the origin.
The velocity of the light that propagated to the origin is
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{c} = {c}
\begin{pmatrix}
0            \\
\sin{\alpha} \\
\cos{\alpha} \\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
</div>
Were \({\alpha}\) is the direction of propagation.
This gives the retarded position the light was emmitted from as
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{r}_{ret} = \mathbf{r} ={c}{{{t}_{ret}}}
\begin{pmatrix}
0            \\
\sin{\alpha} \\
\cos{\alpha} \\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
</div>
The source's position and retarded position are the same in the rest frame as it is not moving.
Also, the position vector and light's velocity vector are in opposite directions, The emitted time being negative flips the direction of the velocity vector here.
Now inputting the retarded position and times in the first frame into the coordinate transform we get the retarded position and time in the primed frame as

\end{equation}
</div>
If instead we use the angle of the retarded coordinate from the z-axis, \(\theta_{ret} = \alpha - \pi\), we have that \(\cos{\alpha}=\cos{\theta_{ret}+\pi}=-\cos{\theta_{ret}}\) and therefor the retarded time is given as
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
\\ {{t}_{ret}^{'}} = {\gamma} \left(1 + \frac{v}{c} \cos{\theta_{ret}} \right) {{{t}_{ret}}}

The coordinate transform here for retarded coordinates is the same as normal coordiante transform, except the time transform simplfies and allows us to take the retarded time out of brackets with just the factor \(\text{Ã…}={\gamma} \left(1-\frac{v}{c} \cos{\alpha} \right) = {\gamma} \left(1 + \frac{v}{c} \cos{\theta_{ret}} \right)\) now infront of it.
This factor will also come up in the doppler effect, in aberration and when finding the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-flux').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-flux').style.display='none'">flux</span> of a field.
We will use it to simplfy equations like we did with \(\gamma\).
We will call \(\text{Ã…}\) the aberrational factor, but it is also refered to as the relativistic doppler factor.
The retarded view of the world is due to the delay in the light from the world.
So at the moment all the light that is being received by the origin is what it sees.
When we transform the retarded coordinates when swapping to another frame, the angle the light is being recieved now to the primed frames origin, which is at the same location at \({t}={t{'}}=0\), is changed, this is called the relativistic aberration of light.
This aberration will be described fully in the next chapter.
<b>Side Note:</b>
This retarded position is at the retarded time, if you wanted to find the position of where the source currently is, we would need to propagate this to the current time of zero of the observer, which after a bit of workingout gives

This gives a different percieved velocity.</figcaption>

The difference between the retarded times of light from each position reaching the origin is
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
dt_{ret} =  \left( dt + \frac{\|\mathbf{r} + d\mathbf{r}\|}{c} \right) -  \frac{\|\mathbf{r}\|}{c}

we can simplfy this expression by using
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\|\mathbf{r} + d\mathbf{r}\| & =  \sqrt{(\mathbf{r} + d\mathbf{r}) \cdot (\mathbf{r} + d\mathbf{r})}                                                                         \\

The distances between the points is the same to the observer as the true distance between them, its just the precieved times that are different.
Therefore we can get the precieved/retarded velocity to be
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{u}_{ret} = \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt_{ret}} = \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{ \left( 1 + \frac{ \mathbf{u} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{r}} }{ c} \right) dt } = \frac{\mathbf{u}}{ 1 + \frac{ \mathbf{u} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{r}} }{ c} }

For speeds of particles between zero and the speeds of light, the denominator can range between zero and two meaning that we can have perceived speeds between zero and infinity.
For something moving at the speed of light, the slowest we could precieve it, which is when its directly moving away, is \(0.5{c}\).

<div id="ch4_content">
<span style="display: hidden">\(\nextSection\)</span>
If light pulse is emmited from a resting point source in all directions in one reference frame, how will this be effected when swaping to a frame where the source is now moving.
This will be the topic of this chapter.
We will look at the velocity transform specifically for the speed of light, which will be used throughout this chapter, starting with looking at the doppler effect on the frequency of light that a source emits.
Next we will get to relativistic aberration, which is the how the angle the emitted light is propagated at, is effected.
Both of these effects together gives relativistic beaming, allowing us to transform a field of continuous pulses of light from a source in the next chapter.
But we will start with looking into the mathematics of spherical polar coordinates which will allow us to look at all of this.
The topics of relativistic aberration and beaming are not topics that are touched upon in most special relativity sources, but they are interesting and hold some important insights, that you will hopefully appreciate.
<h2 id="SphericalPolarCoordinates_header">Spherical Polar Coordinates</h2>
<div id="ch4_1_content">
Before we go any further with special relativity, we will need to take some time making sure we know the math needed for what comes next.
This section will be about spherical polar coordinates and its differential elements, which will be used to get what is called a surface element, and in turn find out what the solid angle is and how to derive it.
This will then lead into finding the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-flux').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-flux').style.display='none'">flux</span> of light through this solid angle element.
Which will be needed when looking at the aberration section.
I realise a lot of these terms may be new to you, but they will be explained as we go.
So lets start with how to describe a vector in terms of the Spherical Polar Coordinates, which is shown in the following figure in red:

<figcaption>&nbsp;<b>Spherical polar coordinates.</b> Diagram of an \(x,y,z\)-axis showing a position vector \(\mathbf{r}\) (red) with its associated spherical polar coordinates \((r,\theta,\phi)\), where \(\theta\) is the angle from the \(z\)-axis, \(\phi\) is the angle rotated around \(z\)-axis starting from the \(x\)-axis, and \(r\) is the magnitude .</figcaption>
</figure>
As the figure shows, for a given position \(\mathbf{r}\) we have the Cartesian coordinates \(({x},{y},{z})\), but we can also write this position in terms of spherical polar coordinates \((r,\theta,\phi)\).
Where the angles from the Z-Axis and X-axis are \(\theta\) (between 0 and \(\pi\)) and \(\phi\) (between 0 and \(2\pi\)) respectively, and \({r}\) is the displacement to the position from the origin.
The position can be written using either coordinate system as follows
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
\bbox[#fff9cf, 10px, border-radius: 10px; border: 3px solid black]{

The speed of light remains the same after transforming between frames, but the velocity does not, as the direction changes.
The velocity transformation in the case where the speed is that of light, \(\|u\| = {c}\), with the direction in the initial frame at an angle \(\alpha\) from the z-axis and \(\varphi\) from the x-axis, so that the velocity of light in spherical polar coordinates is

\\
& \text{at position \(\mathbf{r}{'}\) and time \({t{'}}\) }

\end{equation}
</div>
This still has the same speed of light, which can be shown by taking the magnitude of the velocity vector (that is the square root of the squares of all its elements).
However, the angle of propagation has been changed.
We will make use of the transformation of the cosine we can get from the z-component which gives
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}

\cos\alpha{'} = \dfrac{{\gamma} \left( \cos\alpha-\frac{v}{c} \right)}{{\gamma}\left(1-\frac{v}{c} \cos\alpha\right) }
\end{equation}
</div>
with its inverse achieved by swaping the primed and proper coordinates and taking the negative of the frames velocity, giving
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}

\cos\alpha = \dfrac{{\gamma} \left( \cos\alpha{'} + \frac{v}{c} \right)}{{\gamma}\left(1 + \frac{v}{c} \cos\alpha{'}\right) }

\begin{equation}
{d\lambda} = {c}{d\tau}
\end{equation}
</div>
If we change to a frame where the source is now moving at velocity \({\mathbf{u}{'}}\) in the z-direction and we have the wave now emitted at an angle \(\alpha{'}\) from the z-axis, traveling a distance \({c}{dt{'}}\) in a time \({dt{'}}\), with the source moving a distance \( u{'} \cos\alpha{'} {dt{'}}\) in the direction of this emitted wave, this leads to a bunching up of the wave in the direction of the movement of the source, as the same amount of the wave has been emitted in this primed time, but the distance it has traveled from source is
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
{d\lambda{'}} = {c}{dt{'}}-{u}{'} \cos\alpha{'} {dt{'}} = (1-\frac{u{'}}{c}\cos\alpha{'})cdt{'}

we have \({dt{'}} = {\gamma} {d\tau}\), so the ratio of space the wave is taking up in that direction compared to in the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-proper-frame').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-proper-frame').style.display='none'">rest frame</span> is

\begin{equation}
Ratio = \frac{d\lambda{'}}{d\lambda} = {\gamma} \left(1-\dfrac{u{'}}{c} \cos\alpha{'} \right)
\end{equation}
</div>
since wavelength is inversely proportional to the frequency, and this bunching up at the front will proportionally decrease the wavelength, the frequency ratio \(\nu{'}/\nu\) is then
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}

\Phi_{r} = \frac{\nu{'}}{\nu} = \frac{d\lambda}{d\lambda{'}} = \frac{1}{ {\gamma} \left(1-\dfrac{u{'}}{c} \cos\alpha{'} \right)}
\end{equation}

<br>It can be seen from equation <span class="ref_eq" onmouseover="copyContent('eq: Cosine transform','equation_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('equation_hover');">\eqref{eq: Cosine transform}</span> that as a source's speed tends to the speed of light, \(u'/c\) tends to 1 and as a result, \(\cos\alpha{'}\) tends to 1.
Hence all emitted or absorbed light in the source's rest frame tends to the direction of the source's movement.
But we also have to remember that the flow of time of the moving source relative to the primed frame, will become infinitly slow, coming to a stop at the speed of light.
That is, the act of emittance of the light stalls.
For both these reasons the light would remain in the vicinity of the source.

There is a delay in the time light is emitted from a source and the time it reaches a reciever, so there is a difference in where you see moving objects compared to where they currently are due to this, and if the object is moving at velocity \(\mathbf{u'}\) you see it in a previous position \(\mathbf{u'} {T}'_{ret}\) due to this, this is called its retarded position where it was at the retarded time \({T}'_{ret}\).
The time the object and the light took to propagate from the objects retarded position to where they currently are is the same, \(T'_{p}=-{T}'_{ret}\).
We can use the following figure to find the retarded position, and work out the distance \(L'_{p}=\|\mathbf{c'} {T}'_{p}\|\) it has traveled from the retarded position in terms of the positions coordinates and the objects velocity.
This is done by first finding the propagation time in terms of the observers coordinates and the objects velocity, which can be derived from the following figure:

\begin{derivation}
The triangle that the three vectors make allow us to get the equation for the velocity of the light as
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{c'} T'_{p} = \mathbf{u'} T'_{p} + \mathbf{l'}
\end{equation}
</div>
with \(\mathbf{l'}=(l_x',l_y',l_z')\), writing out the vectors and rearanging to get the velocity vector for propagated light, gives
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{c'} = \frac{c}{ T'_{p}}
\begin{pmatrix}
l_x' \\
l_y' \\
l_z' + u' T'_{p}
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
</div>
The magnitude of the lights displacement is equal to the distance the light travels in the corresponding propagation time \( c T'_{p} = \|\mathbf{c'} T'_{p}\|\). The square of this gives
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\left( c T'_{p}\right)^2 & = \|\mathbf{c'} T'_{p}\|^2                        \\
& = (l_x'^2 + l_y'^2 + l_z'^2) + u'^2 {T'_{p}}^2 + 2u' T'_{p} l_z,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
</div>
rearranging this, we get the quadratic
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
{T'_{p}}^{2} - \left(2\gamma^2\frac{u'}{c^2} l_z'\right)T'_{p} - \frac{\gamma^2}{c^2}(l_x'^2 + l_y'^2 + l_z'^2) = 0,
\end{equation}
</div>
where \(\gamma = (1 - u'^2/c^2)^{-1/2}\). Now taking the solution for the past time, and making use of the identity
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
\gamma^2 = 1+\gamma^2\frac{u'^2}{c^2},
\end{equation}
</div>
we get the result (you can skip past this if you would like, as it doesnt add to understanding)
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
T'_{p} & = \gamma^2\frac{u'}{c^2}z' + \sqrt{\left(-\gamma^2\frac{u'}{c^2} l_z' \right)^2+\frac{\gamma^2}{c^2}(l_x'^2 + l_y'^2+ l_z'^2)} \\
& = \gamma^2\frac{u'}{c^2} l_z' + \frac{\gamma}{c}\sqrt{l_x'^2+ l_y'^2+\left(1+\gamma^2\frac{u'^2}{c^2}\right) l_z'^2}        \\
& = \gamma^2\frac{u'}{c^2} l_z' + \frac{\gamma}{c}\sqrt{l_x'^2 + l_y'^2+\gamma^2 l_z'^2}                                      \\
& = \gamma^2\frac{u'}{c^2} l_z' + \frac{\gamma}{c} L
\end{split}
\end{equation}
</div>
with \( L=\sqrt{l_x'^2+l_y'^2+\gamma^2 l_z'^2}\).
This is the time it has taken to propagate the light from where the source was when it was emitted to reach the current position.
\end{derivation}
The propagated distance between where the light was emmited and its current position, can then be given from this derivation of \(T'_{p}\) as
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}

L'_{p} = cT'_{p} = \gamma^2 \frac{u'}{c} l_z' + \gamma  L
\end{equation}
</div>
this can then be used to find out how much the intensity of a field composed of spherical pulses of light from the moving source has dispated. as so we can find the density of light at a particular point in the field.
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}

\bbox[#fff9cf, 10px, border-radius: 10px; border: 3px solid black]{
\mathbf{c'} = \frac{c}{ \frac{u'}{c} \gamma \frac{l_z'}{L} + 1}

\frac{1}{\gamma}  \frac{l_y'}{L} \\
\gamma \frac{l_z'}{L} + \frac{u'}{c}
\end{pmatrix}
}
\end{equation}
</div>
We can find the cosine of the angle from the z-axis from the z-component of the unit vector of the velocity of light that is equal to the z-component of this equation with its magnitude \(c\) removed, giving
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}

\cos{\alpha'} = \frac{\gamma \frac{l_z'}{L} + \frac{u'}{c}}{ \frac{u'}{c} \gamma \frac{l_z'}{L} + 1}
\end{equation}
</div>
The reason I have explained this seperate this from the next subsection, is that I want to emphasise that the gamma function \(\gamma\) has a role to play in retarded positions and times before we even get to swapping frames.
It has to be this way to allow us to swap between frames smoothly, in special relativity.
A reminder here, being that we are not changing betwen frames, we are just looking at the delay in signal that light has to get to a particular point, even though we have made use of the gamma symbol to simply the equations like we do in special relativity, we are not evoking special special relativity, but we will be looking at this when swapping between frames in the next section.
We could just as easily have said that this setup system is an initial frame and used the coordinates without the symbol to represent a primed frame (\('\)), but we have the choice to denote this as the primed frame, and this will help in a later chapter.

<h2 id="EmittedLightWhenSwappingFrame_header">Emitted Light When Swapping Frame</h2>
<div id="ch4_7_content">
This section is similar to what we have just done, but the emphasis here will be on swapping between frames, and will be used in the next chapter when we have continuous pulses of light in all directions from a source and want to see how this field of light transforms and what it looks like for moving sources.
Here, we will look at light being emitted from a source at rest first and then swap to a frame where the source is now moving, using the lorentz transformation of the emitted lights current locations (from \(\mathbf{r}\) to \(\mathbf{r}{'}\)), but remembering these lorentz transformed times \(t'\) are not sychronised with the sources time of zero.
To find this we need to use primed velocity of light \(\mathbf{c}{'}\) to propagate back the light from where it is at \(t'\) to were it was at the origins time of zero.
To get this position \(L'\) where the light is at the syncronised time of zero with the source, we can use the triangle formed in figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: primed frame 1','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: primed frame 1}</span>), which gives \(\mathbf{L}' = (\mathbf{c}' - \mathbf{u'}) t'_p\).
The time \(t'_p\) taken for the light to propagate from the source to point \(\mathbf{L}'\) in the primed frame, is the dilated propagation time (\(t'_p = \gamma t_p\))

*** - different mathematical properties of this field of light
This chapter will look at a source that continuously emits evenly distributed pulses of light radially outwards, giving in its rest frame a "field" of light that spreads out the further it is from the source.
The amount this is spread out, at a distance \(r\), is proportional to the inverse square of the distance \(1/r^2\).
The inverse square law is used to decribe how the classical forces between two masses or charges disipate with the distance between them.
How this "field" looks is shown in the first diagram in figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: full field transformation','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: full field transformation}</span>), with the second diagram in the figure showing how this "field" of light would look like in a frame with the source now moving, using equation <span class="ref_eq" onmouseover="copyContent('eq: time synced transform','equation_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('equation_hover');">\eqref{eq: time synced transform}</span> to transform each part of the pulses of light.
This second frame shows the combination of the relativistic doppler and aberration effects together, which is called relativistic beaming.
The third diagram of the figure shows the rings of each pulse, the doppler effect in each direction can be seen from the ammount of spreading out or compacting of the rings in that direction, with the aberrational effect being shown on each particular ring with how the light is spread out on that ring.
Now that we have the means to transform this "field" of light, we can look at some of its physical/mathematical features/properties, looking at each feature in it rest frame and then finding out how it extends to a frame in which it is moving.
First we will look at the flux of light at each point which is a measure of the rate of flow at each position.
Then we will look at a few properties that are proportional to the square of the distance from the source in its rest frame (properties that have an inverse sqaure law), and see what these look like for frames in which the sources are now moving.
So lets start by seeing what this light looks like in each frame.

If we define a sphere with radius \(r\) we can find an infinitesimal portion of the surface of the sphere at angles \({\theta}\) and \({\phi}\) as shown on this figure:

<figcaption>&nbsp;<b>Differential surface element on a sphere</b> This shows a surface element on a sphere of radius \(r\) that spans from \(\theta\) to \(\theta + d\theta\) and \(\phi\) to \(\phi + d\phi\) in spherical polar coordinates, the surface element is equivalent to a rectangle with sides \(r d\theta\) and \({r}\sin\theta {d\phi}\), giving the infinitesimal surface area of \(r^2 \sin\theta \,\mathrm{d}\theta \,\mathrm{d}\phi\).</figcaption>

The surface element at a constant radius \({r}\), spanning from \(\theta\) to \(\theta + d\theta\) and \(\phi\) to \(\phi + d\phi\) on a spherical surface is equivalent to a rectangle with sides \({r}{dr}\) and \({r}\sin\theta {d\phi}\) giving the surface area as
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{d}S =  r^2 \sin\theta \,\mathrm{d}\theta \,\mathrm{d}\phi
\end{equation}
</div>
This surface elements size depends on the angle from the z-axis and the distance from the origin, but if we want a quantity that only depends on the angle, we can divide the surface element by \(r^2\), this gives what is called the solid angle.
The solid angle element \(d\Omega\) is a measure of the amount of the field of view, from the origin, that the surface element covers. For the differential surface element shown in the figure we have the differential solid angle
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{d}\Omega = \frac{\mathrm{d}S}{r^2} = \sin\theta \,\mathrm{d}\theta \,\mathrm{d}\phi
\end{equation}
</div>
If we were to integrate this over the whole sphere \( \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^{\pi} \, \sin \phi \, d\theta \, d\phi\), we would get \(4\pi\), which is when the view from the origin is fully covered by the surface.
The fraction of the view from the origin that is covered by a solid angle \(\Omega\) is given by \(\Omega/ 4\pi\).

If there is an amount of light/quantity of light \(Q\) in the solid angle element, then the density of light in the solid angle in both frames is \(Q/d\Omega\) and \(Q/d\Omega{'}\) respectively, giving the ratio of the density in the solid angle element in the primed frame relative to the rest frame as

<div id="ch5_3_1_content">
In the previous chapter of a single spherical pulse in the rest frame, we have a surface of a sphere that the pulse creates, getting bigger as it propagates outwards, with the surface area of a sphere equal to \(4 \pi r^2\).
Since there is the same amount of light in this increasing sphere and the area of this sphere's surface increases relative to the square of its radius.
We have the surface area density on this sphere being proportional to the inverse square of the radius \(1/r^2\). This is the angular/azimuthal density.
For the case of light being continuously emitted, the light is spherically symetric and is emitted from the stationary source at a constant rate, and therefore has no change in density in the direction that is radially outwards, and only a difference in the direction perpendicular to this, i.e. the angular direction, which is parralel to the spherical surface each pulse creates, giving the total scalar density of light at any point \(D\) as being proportional to the inverse square of the radius \(1/r^2\),
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
D = \frac{k}{r^2}
\end{equation}
</div>
where k is the proportionality constant
<h4 id="GeneralEquationsforMovingSource_header">General Equations for Moving Source</h4>
*** look back at section 4.8 to update this to use the surface area element instead
If we have position \((x',y',z')\), we need to use the distance the light had to propagate from where it was emmited to get to that position, which is given in equation <span class="ref_eq" onmouseover="copyContent('eq: propagation distance','equation_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('equation_hover');">\eqref{eq: propagation distance}</span>, to allow us to find out how much the the lights density has disipated from when it was emmited, giving the disipation to be proportional to
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{L_p'^2} = \frac{1}{\left( \gamma^2 \frac{u'}{c} z' + \gamma  L \right)^2}
\end{equation}
</div>
giving the disipation with the angular denisty of the light from equation <span class="ref_eq" onmouseover="copyContent('eq: aberration density weighting','equation_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('equation_hover');">\eqref{eq: aberration density weighting}</span> as
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
\frac{\gamma^2 \left( 1 +\frac{u'}{c} \gamma \frac{z'}{ L} \right)^2}{\left( \gamma^2 \frac{u'}{c} z' + \gamma  L \right)^2} = \frac{1}{  L^2}
\end{equation}
</div>
The doppler effect from equation <span class="ref_eq" onmouseover="copyContent('eq: Doppler Effect','equation_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('equation_hover');">\eqref{eq: Doppler Effect}</span> also gives the change in lights density, but this time in the direction of the light's propagation relative to the rest frame as

\begin{equation}
\Phi_{r} = \frac{d\lambda}{d\lambda{'}} = \frac{1}{ {\gamma} \left(1-\dfrac{u{'}}{c} \cos\alpha{'} \right)}
\end{equation}
</div>
Now combining these gives the density of light at any point as
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
D = \frac{\Phi_{r}}{ L^2} = \frac{1}{{\gamma} \left(1-\dfrac{u{'}}{c} \cos\alpha{'} \right)  L^2}  = \frac{\gamma \left( 1 +\frac{u'}{c} \gamma \frac{z'}{ L} \right)}{ L^2}

which is proportional to \(1/R\), the thing i told ya about
the distance between two points on a sphere are proportianl to the angle between them and the radius, so with constant angle you get them we have it proportian to \(R\) which should be related
this does not work in spherical polar Coordinates

Quantities that are frame-independent, i.e.
do not change when we transform between inertial reference frames, are called <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-lorentz-invariant').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-lorentz-invariant').style.display='none'">Lorentz invariant</span>.
In this chapter, we will see the invariant quantity related to space-time coordinates and use this to find invariant properties associated with velocity, which will lead to the more abstract conservation relation of momentum energy and mass.
We will find a new quantity with the units of energy that has a term which approximates to the kinetic energy of a particle at low velocities and another term that suggests particles have a new type of energy, that was not previously in classical physics, that depends on the mass of a particle (mass-energy equivalence), this will all lead to a new conservation law of energy.
The reason we care about the concept of energy is that it has a conservation relation that can be used as a tool to help us make calculations and model more complex systems.
<h2 id="Space-TimeInterval_header">Space-Time Interval</h2>
<div id="ch6_1_content">
We define a quantity called the space-time interval \(\Delta S\) between two <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-event').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-event').style.display='none'">event</span>s in a generic inertial reference frame as:

\Delta S^2 = (c\Delta t)^2-{\Delta x}^2-{\Delta y}^2-{\Delta z}^2

\end{equation}
</div>
All inertial frames of reference agree on this interval as it is invariant between frames, as \(\Delta S = \Delta S{'}\), which can be shown when we sub the values from equation <span class="ref_eq" onmouseover="copyContent('eq: interval of Coordinates','equation_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('equation_hover');">\eqref{eq: interval of Coordinates}</span> into the primed version of this last equation

<div id="ch6_2_content">
From here forward we will be making some jumps in logic and assertions, leading to claims of what we will call the total energy and rest mass energy, but I will try to give as much reasoning as I can for these choices in assertions.
We can see from the previous section that if a particle is moving in a particular inertial reference frame, we can define the space-time interval of its coordinates in this frame as
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
\Delta S_p^2 = (c\Delta {t}_p)^2-\Delta x_p^2-{\Delta y_p}^2-{\Delta z_p}^2
\end{equation}
</div>
and if we divide by the square of the proper time that passes for the particle in this interval \({\Delta\tau}\), so that now taking the limit as the change in time in the interval goes to zero, we get an abstract invariant quantity that we will call the space-time velocity
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\left(\frac{dS_p}{d\tau}\right)^2 & = \left(c\frac{{{dt}_{p}}}{d\tau}\right)^2-\left(c\frac{dx_p}{d\tau}\right)^2-\left(\frac{dy_p}{d\tau}\right)^2-\left(\frac{dz_p}{d\tau}\right)^2 \\
& = {c}^2\gamma^2 \left( 1-\frac{{{u}_{x}}^2 + {{u}_{y}}^2 + {{u}_{z}}^2}{{c}^2} \right) = {c}^2\gamma^2 \left( 1-\frac{u^2}{{c}^2} \right) \\
& = {c}^2
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
</div>
It can be seen that this is still an invariant quantity as the speed of light is constant in all frames.
Now by multiplying both sides by \({c}^2\) and the square of the rest mass \({m}\) of the particle we have the square of an invariant quantity with the units of energy, that is equal to \({m}{c}^2\) and give the equation to be
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}

\begin{aligned}
m^2 {c}^2 \left(\frac{dS_p}{d\tau}\right)^2 & = \gamma^2 m^2 c^4-\gamma^2 m^2 \left( {{u}_{x}}^2 + {{u}_{y}}^2 + {{u}_{z}}^2 \right) {c}^2 \\
({m}{c}^2)^2                                & = \gamma^2 m^2 c^4-\gamma^2 m^2 u^2 {c}^2
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
</div>
rearranging, we get
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}

\left( \gamma m {c}^2 \right)^2 = ({m}{c}^2)^2 + \left( \gamma {m}{u}{c}\right)^2
\end{equation}
</div>
using the Taylor expansion of \(\gamma\) on the quantity \(\gamma {m}{c}^2\), we have for the squared term on the lefthand side
*** this needs to be taylor expansion of squared term on lhs, not the none squared term
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
\gamma = 1 + \frac{1}{2}\frac{u^2}{{c}^2} + \frac{3}{8}\frac{u^4}{c^4} + ...
\end{equation}
</div>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\gamma {m}{c}^2 & = {m}{c}^2  \left(1 + \frac{1}{2}\frac{u^2}{{c}^2} + \frac{3}{8}\frac{u^4}{c^4} + ...
\right)                                                                                                     \\
& = {m}{c}^2 + \frac{1}{2}{m}{u}^2 + \frac{3}{8}m\frac{u^4}{{c}^2} + ...
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
</div>
This equation's first quantity is an energy that does not depend on the speed of the particle, and only on its rest mass, we shall call this the rest mass energy, and this can be taken as a new type of energy all masses have even when at rest.
The second quantity is the classical kinetic energy formula, the rest may be seen as higher-order kinetic energy terms that are very small for \({u}\lt \lt {c}\), so this seems to be a formula for the total energy of a particle in the absence of a potential field (i.e.
no change in potential energy) with added terms which become non-negligible at larger particle speeds, we will denote this total energy \({E}\).
Taking this assertion we have
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
E^2 = \left( {m}{c}^2 \right)^2 + (\gamma{m}{u})^2{c}^2
\end{equation}
</div>
so this total energy is equal to its rest energy squared plus a second energy squared that depends on its speed, this second quantity along with the Taylor expansion of \(\gamma\) gives
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\gamma {m}{u}{c} & = {m}{u}{c} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2}\frac{u^2}{{c}^2} + \frac{3}{8}\frac{u^4}{c^4} + ...
\right)                                                                                                       \\
& ={c}\left( {m}{u} + \frac{1}{2}m \frac{u^3}{{c}^2} + \frac{3}{8}m\frac{u^5}{c^4} + ...
\right)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
</div>
which at small particle velocities is approximately \({m}{u}{c}\) with \({m}{u}\) being the classical momentum, we could assert that this whole energy is momentum in the relativistic context, i.e.
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
p = \gamma {m}{u}
\end{equation}
</div>
as it has the same units and is approximately the classical momentum at small particle speeds.
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
E_0 = {m}{c}^2
\end{equation}
</div>
This is the energy it has from its rest mass, if a particle a particle at rest was to decay into photons, the photons emitted from this would be equal to this energy.
The final energy-momentum equation is then given as
<div class="math">
\begin{equation}
\bbox[#fff9cf, 10px, border-radius: 10px; border: 3px solid black]{
E^2 = E_0^2 + (pc)^2
