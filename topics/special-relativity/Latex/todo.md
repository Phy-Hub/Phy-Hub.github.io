# specific todos:
-  change diagams to simplfied train carraige instead (in javascript diagram, i could add rectangle with grey background and two circles for wheels to represent simplified train cariage, and generalise it, so that i can be used for all the diagrams with minor changes)

-  brief overview of chapter and how it is linked to other chapters
    -  what is needed from previous chaoters for this one
-  state objectives and key take aways
-  explain importance of this chapter
-  make sure this flows from previous chapter

* How is this chapter linked to the previous and next chapters?
    - Why was the previous chapter important for this one?
    - why is this chapter important for the rest of the chapters?
* What will this chapter cover and what is its structure?
* What is the learning objective for this chapter? what should they be able to understand by the end of it?
* Why the topic is important to other topics in the book?
* what are the key concepts in this chapter and what sections from previously will be used to help us in this chapter?

... sections

meaningful conclusion / recap section:

-  summarise the key points and how they relate to other parts of book
-  discuss implications and applications of chapters concepts
-  draw conections between this chapter and other chapters
    -  what this will allow us to look at later
-  pose points to relfect on
-  give questions still to be answered which will be in later chapters
-  final sentence to allow this to flow into next chapter

List of variables or definitions from chapter

### Sections:

meaningful introduction:

-  Intial sentence to allow this to flow from previous section
    -  what sections this pulls from
-  brief overview
-  state objectives and key take aways
-  explain importance of this section if needed
-  make sure this flows from previous section
-  add recap sentence or paragrapgh for each section

... paragraphs
... figures

meaningful conclusion:

-  summarise the key points
-  discuss implications and applications of concepts
-  draw conections between other sections
    -  what this will be used in later
-  final sentence to allow this to flow into next section

### Paragraphs

- each paragraph should be one thought, idea or theme
-  use bolding of words in latex to highlight important phrases and parts
-  use basic sentences to make the most important points, i.e. subject - verb - object sentences
-  paragraph structure:
    - say what you are going to say, say it, say that you have said it i.e.
    - topic sentence, suporting sentence, closing setence
-  linking sentence startings: thats why, for this reason, since, so, therefore
-  for sequence sentences: to begin, to start, first/firstly,next, then, after that, finally, lastly
-  referenceing backwards, as we have seen, as we saw, as explained, as discused, as illustrated, as shown, as described, as talked about
-  referenceing forward: as we will see later, as discussed below, as .... below
-  maybe replace some ocassions of "relative to an observer" with "relative to  you"
- Use transition words and phrases to guide your reader through your text. from paragraph to paragrapgh and section to section, so that things flow


### Figures

-  concise and informative title that describes the content of the figure
-  identify the type of diagram
-  should be able to be understood as a standalone
-  clear and concise expalination of what is shown
    -  what concepts are shown/observed
    -  mention any meathods or equations used for it
-  defined all symbols and features
-  relevance/link to main text
-  If the figure is complex, include a sentence interpreting it, or leave to main text
-  use italics for variables and scientific names

-  captions:
    - Start the caption with a complete sentence that summarizes the main point of the figure (e.g., "Figure 1. The relationship between force, mass, and acceleration is illustrated by Newton's second law.")
    - Explain how the figure fits into the broader concept being discussed.
    - The caption should be understandable without needing to refer to the main text.
    Example: Figure 1. \textbf{The Doppler effect in sound waves}. The diagram shows how the frequency (pitch) of a sound wave changes as the source of the sound moves relative to the observer. When the source moves towards the observer, the waves are compressed, resulting in a higher frequency (blue waves). When the source moves away, the waves are stretched, resulting in a lower frequency (red waves).

-  Referencing:
    - "As shown in Figure 1..."
    - "The Doppler effect, illustrated in Figure 1, explains why..."


### Book Outro chapter

meaningful conclusion:

-  summarise the key points that were discussed in the book
-  discuss implications and applications of these points
-  propose areas of expansion for this topic/ future research
-  what the reader can do next to expand knowledge (i.e. internal and external resources)
