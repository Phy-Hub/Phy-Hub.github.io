# Line 260: To illustrate this, we will look at a setup of two rats on a treadmill with a platform as shown in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: 3d conveyor belt','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: 3d conveyor belt}</span>), with three rocks hanging above the platform, which are at rest relative to the room.

# Line 313: So, an experimental setup by Michelson and Morley, shown in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: Michelson_morley','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: Michelson_morley}</span>), called an interferometer, was devised to measure Earth's movement through the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-aether').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-aether').style.display='none'">aether</span> \cite{EtherExperiment}, by measuring how it affected the return times of light emitted in different directions, as observed in Earth's <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-Reference-frame').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-Reference-frame').style.display='none'">reference frame</span>.
# Line 332: The observed speed of light is independent of how fast the source and receiver of that light are moving in the frame, as shown with a moving truck's headlights in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: truck torch','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: truck torch}</span>).
# Line 337: When we look at the same truck setup as in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: truck cannonball','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: truck cannonball}</span>), but now have it in a <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-vacuum').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-vacuum').style.display='none'">vacuum</span>, where the cannon firing a cannonball is swapped for headlights emitting light, we will find the same speed of light when measured relative to the truck or the road, but how can this be true?
# Line 343: This is because the velocities of objects must be added in a way that is consistent with the requirement that the speed of light is constant but also gives the approximate classical addition at speeds of objects at much less than the speed of light, like how we observed in the situation with the cannon and truck, shown in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: truck cannonball','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: truck cannonball}</span>).
# Line 346: For the curious, it was the \href{https://scienceready.com.au/pages/determination-of-speed-of-light}{experiment by Ole RÃ¸mer} that showed that light traveled at a finite speed rather than being instantaneously emitted and received.
# Line 352: Consider a simple clock, as shown in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: truck clock','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: truck clock}</span>), made of a light pulse moving back and forth vertically between two mirrors on a moving truck, one on the truck's floor and the other on the roof directly above it.
# Line 362: How much slower the time is passing in the moving truck relative to the road observer can be solved using the ratio of the lengths of the paths in each frame as shown in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: truck clock','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: truck clock}</span>), as this is the same ratio as the time between the ticks.
# Line 369: You may ask about the possibility that the distance between the floor and roof of the truck becoming smaller the faster the truck is moving relative to the road, to allow for the light clock to tick at the same speed, and to get rid of the need for the time dilation, but that would actually lead to contradictions which will be shown later in figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: width contraction','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: width contraction}</span>).
# Line 383: However, the light reflects off each wall's mirrors at different times in the road's frame to do this, as shown in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: truck simultaneity','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: truck simultaneity}</span>).
# Line 408: The time between the light being emitted and absorbed from the light bulb is the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-time-dilation').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-time-dilation').style.display='none'">dilated time</span>, that was described in section (\ref{Subsect: Time Dilation}).
# Line 410: We can work out the length of the up and downward path from the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-time-dilation').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-time-dilation').style.display='none'">time dilation</span> section (\ref{Subsect: Time Dilation}), and this is the length the path needs to be in the horizontal directions as well.
# Line 426: If we look at the possibility that a moving object contracts in the direction perpendicular to the direction of its movement, we find out that this leads to contradictions, as shown in figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: width contraction','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: width contraction}</span>).
# Line 440: Suppose we have three equally distanced cars at rest on the road, as shown in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: cars','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: cars}</span>).
# Line 476: We will show that there is a higher concentration of light in the direction of the source's movement, as shown in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: truck aberrated','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: truck aberrated}</span>).
# Line 477: With the help of the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-length-contraction').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-length-contraction').style.display='none'">length contraction</span> section (\ref{subsect: Length Contraction}), Consider a truck with a spherical mirrored container, with a central bulb emitting light in all directions.
# Line 511: Then in a second frame with the source now moving, the doppler effect has the spherical pulse's wavelength bunched up in the direction of movement (giving a change in the color of the light), with the aberrational effect also giving the angular spread of the light at a higher concentration in the direction of the movement of the source, as shown in figures (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: Relativistic Beaming','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: Relativistic Beaming}</span>).
# Line 547: So if we have a source in its rest frame that continually emits pulses of light with a constant time between each pulse, we get what is shown in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: vector field of light source rest frame','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: vector field of light source rest frame}</span>).
# Line 549: We also have the dilated time between pulses in this moving frame, so using these and the beaming effect from the previous section we get the light's vector field as shown in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: vector field of light source primed frame','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: vector field of light source primed frame}</span>).
# Line 585: Imagine that a ball one light year away (the distance it takes light to travel in a year) is fired directly towards you, as shown in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: perceived vs actual speed','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: perceived vs actual speed}</span>).

# Line 614: But an observer standing still on the road sees the light hit both walls at different times, as shown in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: truck simultaneity','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: truck simultaneity}</span>).

# Line 668: So let us see how the mathematics works for the classical coordinate system transform between two inertial observers frames, by looking at the coordinates of an event in an initial reference frame with a second inertial frame's coordinate axis moving relative to the initial frame's, illustrated in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: simple Galilean transform derivation','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: simple Galilean transform derivation}</span>):
# Line 671: <figcaption>Figure 2.1: <b>An event in initial frame with a primed frame's axis moving relative to its axis.</b>	This shows an initial frame with its associated \(x,y,z\)-coordinate system at rest in this frame, with origin \({O}\). There is also an \(x',y',z'\)-coordinate system with origin \({O'}\) associated with the "primed" frame, at position \({\vec{OO'}}=(0,0,{v}{t})\) in the initial frame, where \({v}\) is the speed of the primed frame in the z-direction relative to the initial frame, and \({t}\) is the time in the initial frames. An event \({\vec{E}}\) in this initial frame is described by a set of spatial and time coordinates \({\mathbf{r}} = ({x},{y},{z})\) and \({t}\). We choose the time to be zero in both frames when both axes overlapped, so that \({t}\) is also the time from when they overlapped. We also show \({\vec{O'E}}\) which represents the vector from the primed axis origin to the event in the initial frame.</figcaption>
# Line 704: To swap into the primed frame's coordinates, we need to recall from the previous assumptions that distances and times are conserved, and therefore the length and directions of all the vectors between \({O}\), \({O^{'}}\) and \({E}\) are the same in each frame, and time flows at the same rate (\({t'} = {t}\)), from this knowledge and Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: simple Galilean transform derivation','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: simple Galilean transform derivation}</span>) we have the event's coordinates described in the primed frame by its coordinate axis as
# Line 742: You might have noticed that the direction of the second frame is in the upward z-direction instead of being to the right in the case of the truck diagrams from the previous chapter, this is to help us when we use spherical polar coordinates later and to help see the symmetries. But that is a couple of chapters away, for now we will look at the assumptions of special relativity and their consequences, which we will then apply to the same notion of an event that we have in the Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: simple Galilean transform derivation','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: simple Galilean transform derivation}</span>).

# Line 761: It keeps time by measuring when light returns to the first mirror, counting it as one tick of its clock, as shown in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: light clock','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: light clock}</span>).
# Line 776: <br>The light in the clock, takes a time \({\Delta\tau}\) in the clock's rest frame to make the return journey.
# Line 777: We can see from Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: light clock rest frame','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: light clock rest frame}</span>) that in the rest frame, the distance the light travels to the mirror and back in this time is
# Line 789: where \({\Delta t{'}}\) is the time it took light to return in the moving frame and \({u}\) is the speed of the light clock, which is in the opposite direction of the movement of the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-Primed-Frame').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-Primed-Frame').style.display='none'">primed frame</span> relative to the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-proper-frame').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-proper-frame').style.display='none'">rest frame</span>, that is \({u} =-{v}\).
# Line 796: This is the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle formed by \({u}{\Delta t{'}}=-{v}{\Delta t{'}}\) and \(2{L}\), so we have the square of the hypotenuse equal to the square of the other two lengths:
# Line 814: This factor, \({\gamma}\), is used throughout special relativity to simplify equations.
# Line 829: So there is now light moving perpendicular as well as parallel the the primed frame's movement, as shown in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: length contraction math','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: length contraction math}</span>)
# Line 844: <br>If we have a system as described in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: length contraction math','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: length contraction math}</span>).
# Line 850: In the moving frame, to achieve this simultaneity in the return of the light to the bulb, the length of the full path of light from the central bulb to the front mirror and back (\(2 {\Delta L^{'}} = {l^{'}_1} + {l^{'}_2}\)) must be the same as the perpendicular path, due to the speed of light being the same for both paths.
# Line 851: We can work out the length of the sideways paths from the time dilation section, \({c}{\Delta t^{'}}\), and this is the length the total path needs to be in the forward directions as well.
# Line 853: Note that there can not be a contraction in the perpendicular direction to the movement due to the paradox explained in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: width contraction','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: width contraction}</span>).
# Line 861: where \({u}\) is the speed that the front mirror is moving away from the point it was emitted, \({\Delta t^{'}_1}\) is the time taken to get to the mirror, and \({\Delta  L^{'}}\) is the distance between the bulb and the mirror in front in the primed frame.
# Line 868: Where \({\Delta t^{'}_2}\) is the time taken to return to the bulb from the front mirror, with the source moving twowards the reflected light.
# Line 887: where we used \({u}=-{v}\) and then the \({\gamma}\) factor to simplfy equation.
# Line 913: For the derivation of the coordinate transformation of an event between two inertial frames, we will be starting with the same diagram as we had in the classical relativity in Section (\ref{sect: Classical Relativity}) and apply what we have learned from the time dilation and length contraction sections so that we can be consistent with the postulates of special relativity.
# Line 917: <figcaption>Figure 2.4: <b>An event in initial frame with a primed frame's axis moving relative to it.</b> This shows an initial frame with its associated \(x,y,z\)-coordinate system at rest in this frame, with origin \({O}\). There is also an \(x',y',z'\)-coordinate system with origin \({O'}\) associated with the "primed" frame, at position \({\vec{OO'}}=(0,0,{v}{t})\) in the initial frame, where \({v}\) is the speed of the primed frame in the z-direction relative to the initial frame, and \({t}\) is the time in the initial frames. An event \({\vec{E}}\) in this initial frame is described by a set of spatial and time coordinates \({\mathbf{r}} = ({x},{y},{z})\) and \({t}\). We choose the time to be zero in both frames when both axes overlapped, so that \({t}\) is also the time from when they overlapped. We also show \({\vec{O'E}}\) which represents the vector from the primed origin to the event in the initial frame.</figcaption>
# Line 963: The primed frame's axis and coordinates are moving relative to the initial frame, so from the previous length contraction section we would have the displacement between the primed axis origin and the event in the intial frame \(\vec{O'E}\), length contracted, in the \(z\)-direction, compared to the primed position coordinates in the primed frame \({\mathbf{r}{'}}\), that is
# Line 969: The \(x\) and \(y\)-components are unaffected, with the paradox of it they were effected, explained in Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: width contraction','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: width contraction}</span>).
# Line 995: with \(1/{\gamma}^{2} = 1-{v}^2/{c}^2\) leading to the primed frames time for the event given in initial frames coordinates as
# Line 1026: In the time <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-transform').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-transform').style.display='none'">transform</span> equation the \(\frac{{v}{z}}{{c}^2}\) term is the cause of the <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='none'">simultaneity</span> of <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-event').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-event').style.display='none'">event</span>s at two different positions in one inertial frame no longer being <span onmouseover="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='block'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('def-simultaneity').style.display='none'">simultaneous</span> in another inertial frame, and the \({\gamma}\) factor, is the term that causes the overall change in how fast time flows at a point relative to the initial frame.
# Line 1027: In the spatial coordinate transform equations the the \({v}{t}\) factor is due to both axes' origins moving away from each other and the \({\gamma}\) factor is the cause of the change of lengths in the direction of the frame's movement.
# Line 1028: We can see how points representing the coordinates in an initial frame look like in a primed frame of reference, by looking at Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: coordinate transform','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: coordinate transform}</span>).
# Line 1048: In the primed frame, these points are transformed to the position \({z{'}} = {\gamma} {z}\) and are now moving at speed \(-{v}\), they are transformed using the transformation equations to points that are more spread out in the primed frame, but the times they are located at each of these points are different, they have desynchronized times.
# Line 1049: Therefore to find these points, which represent the coordinates in the initial frame, now in the primed frame at the synchronized time of \({t{'}} = 0\), we must propagate the points to that time, which ends up being \({z{'}} = \frac{{z}}{{\gamma}}\), as shown in figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: coordinate transform subfig_3','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: coordinate transform subfig_3}</span>).
# Line 1051: We will later see a more natural interpretation of the coordinate transforms when we introduce the notion of retarded time in Chapter (\ref{ch: Observers Delayed Worldview}), which will give us another reason for why the time transformation is the way it is.
# Line 1054: If we have the primed frame velocity much smaller than the speed of light, (\(v \ll c\)), then we have \({v}/{c}\approx 0\) and therefore \(\gamma \approx 1\).
# Line 1068: We can see when the \(\gamma\)-factor's influence starts to become significant from Figure (<span class="ref_fig" onmouseover="copyContent('fig: Gamma Factor','fig_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('fig_hover');">\ref{fig: Gamma Factor}</span>).

# Line 1080: If we want to know how the displacement between two coordinates \({\vec{R}_1} = (x_1,y_1,z_1)\) and \({\vec{R}_2} = (x_2,y_2,z_2)\) transforms, we can take the difference of the transforms of both the coordinates as follows
# Line 1091: rearranging and replacing the difference of the first and second of each coordinate with \({\Delta}{\vec{R}} = ({\Delta}x,{\Delta}y,{\Delta}z) = (x_2-x_1,y_2-y_1,z_2-z_1)\), giving the displacement transform as
# Line 1119: For example, the space-time interval and the energy-momentum relationship in Chapter (\ref{ch: Invariant Quantities}).
# Line 1124: The velocity at any instant is the infinitesimal change in position over the infinitesimal change in time \(\frac{d\vec{R}}{dt}\).
# Line 1125: So using the infinitesimals from Equation <span class="ref_eq" onmouseover="copyContent('eq: Infintesmal interval of Coordinates','equation_hover');" onmouseout="deleteContent('equation_hover');">\eqref{eq: Infintesmal interval of Coordinates}</span>, we get the velocity in each direction as
# Line 1162: with \({\mathbf{v}}\) being the frame's velocity in any generalized direction.

# Line 1287: The retarded time the pulse of light was emitted is \({{t}_{ret}} =-\frac{\|\mathbf{r}\|}{c}\), which is the negative of the time it took for light to propagate along \({\mathbf{r}}\) to the origin.

# Line 1335: If instead we use the angle of the retarded coordinate from the z-axis, \(\theta_{ret} = \alpha - \pi\), we have that \(\cos{\alpha}=\cos{\theta_{ret}+\pi}=-\cos{\theta_{ret}}\) and therefor the retarded time is given as
# Line 1342: The coordinate transform here for retarded coordinates is the same as normal coordiante transform, except the time transform simplfies and allows us to take the retarded time out of brackets with just the factor \(\text{Ã…}={\gamma} \left(1-\frac{v}{c} \cos{\alpha} \right) = {\gamma} \left(1 + \frac{v}{c} \cos{\theta_{ret}} \right)\) now infront of it.
