\chapter{Conceptual Overview}

Newtonian physics serves as an excellent approximation at low speeds, accurately predicting the behavior of objects in our everyday world, but it gives way to different effects as we approach the speed of light. It turns out that an \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} moving at high speed relative to another \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} would notice lengths contract, time run slower, and \hyperlink{def-event}{event}s that were \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneous} to the other \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}, no longer \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneous} to them. There is however one thing that remains constant, the speed that light travels relative to each \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} is the same. To understand how all this works, we have to redefine our understanding of time and space, with special relativity.

Special relativity is vital for particle, nuclear, and astrophysics. It is needed for calculating the power output when it comes to nuclear fusion and fission or measuring the speed of galaxies and stars from the relativistic effects on the frequency of their emitted light. It is also needed for precision timekeeping for the likes of the fast-moving GPS satellites which need it for accurately calculating positions.

To understand how special relativity works we will need to first look at our classical understanding of the world, and using the fact that light somehow always moves at constant speed relative to everything, we will see how we must change our laws of physics for this to be true. Which in turn will lead to many interesting consequences. We will start with an overview of all the main concepts, leaving the mathematical details and deeper insights for later chapters.

%Special relativity is used in calculating the decay rate of fast-moving particles, and in the physics of particle accelerators (such as finding out how fast a particle needs to move to get to the energy you need to create certain other particles or get certain reactions to occur in a particle accelerator, and the radiation given off by accelerating particles)

%Relativity led to the famous energy-mass equivalence principle $E=mc^2$ which in turn gave us the ability to learn how to use radioactive elements to our advantage with nuclear power and for the more controversial use of making nuclear bombs. and in the future maybe generating power using nuclear fusion.

%In astrophysics it is also used to predict how fast other galaxies are traveling, due to the effect it has on the frequencies of light emitted from fast-moving sources leading to red and blue shifts in light frequencies.

%High precision clocks on a GPS need to use the time differences caused by special relativity, as this along with general relativity (gravitational effects) is used to allow for GPS work more accurately.

%If you want a full descriptive model of a system with moving objects you need to include relativistic effects, but at speeds much less than that of the speed of light the relativistic effects are normally negligible when it comes to modeling physical systems ( but not always… as in electrodynamics of a wire where electrons are moving at low speeds but due to the vast amounts of them and the strength of their electric field they can still give non-negligible effects on the force (magnetic force is due to relativity, will need to explain how this is or have mathematical chapter later explaining this) )

%At speeds close to the magnitude of that of light, relativistic effects are required for accurate positions and times, which also lead to differences in masses and energies of particles, and wavelengths of light.

%In this chapter we will talk about the classical view of how velocities are perceived by different observers, and take a look at how moving between classical coordinate systems works, we will find out how the classical view fails, as we find that for all observers the speed of light seems to be constant and explain the experiment that showed this, then we will move on to the new framework of special relativity needed to explain this, starting with position and time coordinate transformations between different frames and finally on how this affects velocity, momentum, frequency of light waves and energy, that rely on them.

%In trying to make this none mathematical introduction as simple as possible, I have adopted as much of a visual way of explaining each part of special relativity as possible, this first chapter is in no way a fully comprehensive description of special relativity, but it is as close as possible in this chapter without getting into the mathematics, which will be tackled in the next chapters, to give you a much fuller understanding of special relativity.

%Special Relativity is the story about not having a unique rest frame or coordinate system to measure positions and velocities relative to, and that you can only measure an object's speed relative to another reference object, and also the story about how the speed of light in the vacuum of space is kept constant no matter how fast the particle (that emitted the light) was moving relative to the observer, and how this requires a new view of how space and time works, leading to many important changes to our understanding of physics.
%If you are on a train that is accelerating off from a station you will feel the seat being pushed into you, such that you have the feeling that you are being pushed back into your seat, So that you can Know when you are accelerating. But if you were now on a train and did not feel like you were being pushed back into your seat, how would you be able to tell if you were at rest or just moving at a constant speed? you might say that you can see out the window that the land looks as if it is moving relative to you and that you can hear the sound the train wheels make on the track. Well, now what about if there were no windows and the wheels on the track were completely smooth, so that there was no sound or rattling? you would have no reference for the train movement and could not feel any movement, so you could not tell if the train was indeed moving, even if you threw a ball, its trajectory would be the same to you in the train, in both scenarios.

\section{Classical Addition of Velocities}\label{Section classical velocity addition}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=8cm]{images/pdf/lorry_cannonball.pdf}
	\caption{Diagram, showing the speed of cannonball from two different perspectives, (top) is from someone's perspective who is on the truck who sees the cannon at rest with the road moving backward, the cannonball is shot and is moving forward. (bottom) is from someone's perspective who is at rest on the road and sees the truck and cannon moving relative to them, when the cannonball is shot it looks like it is moving forward faster for them, as it seems to have the cannonball's velocity plus that of the truck it was shot from.}
	\label{fig: truck cannonball}
\end{figure}

Let's imagine that a truck is moving forward on a road at a constant speed of 20 m/s (meters per second), on the top of that truck, is a cannon that fires a cannonball in the same direction the truck is moving. The ball travels at a speed of 300 m/s relative to the truck. Classically to find out how fast the ball is moving relative to the road, we add the speed of the truck and the speed of the ball together: 20 + 300 = 320 m/s. So we find the ball is moving at a speed of 320 m/s relative to the road, and this is what we observe. So in classical physics, velocities directly add, the ball relative to the road would move at the speed of the ball relative to the truck plus the truck's speed relative to the road.
But this turns out to just be a very good approximation for objects in our normal day life which we are used to seeing, which are moving much slower than the speed of light (which is roughly 300 000 000 m/s), but we will get to this later. For now, we will explain more about the classical view, so that you will be able to see more clearly the differences when it comes to special relativity.

\section{Inertial Reference Frame}

	\label{fig: Reference Frames}
\end{figure}

A \hyperlink{def-Reference-frame}{reference frame} can be thought of as an abstract coordinate system. The origin of its axis, its orientation, and its scale are specified by a set of points in space. The purpose of it is to provide a standardized means of measuring and describing the coordinates of objects within that frame at any instant of time.

An \hyperlink{def-Inertial-reference-frame}{inertial reference frame}, is a reference frame that is not undergoing any acceleration. You can tell if you are being accelerated, as you will feel a force, for example, in an accelerating car you will feel the chair being accelerated into you, with your body slightly lagging behind in the acceleration, and it is this basic principle for how accelerometers measure acceleration as shown in the diagram.

\section{Classical Reference Frames}

To see how to swap between \hyperlink{def-Reference-frame}{reference frame}s in special relativity we will first have to introduce what the classical swapping between two \hyperlink{def-Reference-frame}{reference frame}s looks like. To help us understand this, we will use a system of a moving platform, like we find on a treadmill. The two frames of reference will be that of the treadmill's platform and the room in which it is in.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/pdf/Conveyor_belt_3d.pdf}
	\caption{Diagram of 3d view of treadmill platform, with two rats and three hanging rocks.}
	\label{fig: 3d conveyor belt}
\end{figure}

To illustrate swapping between frames classically, We will look at a setup of two rats on a treadmill as shown in Figure \ref{fig: 3d conveyor belt}, with three rocks hanging above the platform, at rest relative to the room. Both rats start under the same rock, one runs to a rock positioned in the forward direction of the treadmill, and the other runs to an equally distanced rock to the side, they then return to the starting rock. Here the platform can be seen as the medium in which the rats move. Both rats travel at the same constant speed relative to the platform, with the platform at a lower speed than the rats to allow them to get to the rocks.

If the platform is at rest, they will return to the starting rock at the same time. But if the treadmill is turned on and the platform is now moving, the rats will now have to also work against the movement of the platform to get to the rocks, this will lead to different distances the rats have to travel, and as a result, the rats get back to the starting rock at different times. The figures \ref{fig: rat with moving platform} and \ref{fig: rat platform reference frame} show what the direction of movement of the rats and rocks look like in each \hyperlink{def-Reference-frame}{reference frame}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\begin{subfigure}{.49\textwidth}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/pdf/rats_moving.pdf}

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Rats running on a moving platform of a treadmill from two different \protect\hyperlink{def-Reference-frame}{reference frame}s}
	\label{fig: treadmill}
\end{figure}

\iffalse javascript{Rats_treadmill} \fi

In the room's \hyperlink{def-Reference-frame}{reference frame} we have the platform moving backward, the rat moving straight ahead will have impedance to its movement but after it turns around it now has a boost from the platform to get back to the starting rock, were as the sideways moving rat will have to go sideways and also balances out the backward pull of the platform to keep a perpendicular movement towards the hanging rocks. This gives different lengths of paths depending on the \hyperlink{def-Reference-frame}{reference frame}, as shown in figures \ref{fig: rat with moving platform} and \ref{fig: rat platform reference frame}. It also gives different times for the rats to return to the starting rock. This is what we would expect and see with this classical example of frame swapping, but next, we will look at whether we can have the same sort of frame swapping when it comes to light traveling in two different frames of reference, and the notion of a universal \hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{rest frame} referred to as the \hyperlink{def-aether}{aether}.

\section{The Aether}%, a Medium for Light} % and a Universal Rest Frame}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/pdf/earth_and_aether.pdf}
	\caption{A diagram showing the \protect\hyperlink{def-aether}{aether}'s and earth's movement relative to each other.}
	\label{fig: Aether}
\end{figure}

In the 1800s, the theory was that light was a wave and therefore would need a medium for it to travel through that filled the \hyperlink{def-vacuum}{vacuum} of space, called "the luminiferous \hyperlink{def-aether}{aether}", and that light would travel at a constant speed relative to this \hyperlink{def-aether}{aether}, like how the rats in the previous section moved at a constant speed relative to the medium of the treadmill's platform.

An experimental setup by Michelson and Morley, shown in Fig. \ref{fig: Michelson_morley}, was devised to measure earth's movement through the \hyperlink{def-aether}{aether} \cite{EtherExperiment}, by measuring how it affected the speed of light in different directions when observed in earth's \hyperlink{def-Reference-frame}{reference frame}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=8cm]{images/pdf/Michelson_morley.pdf}
	\caption{A diagram showing the Michelson-Morley experiment, (we can take the part of the paths between the the beam splitter and two mirrors to be analogous to the case of the paths in the previous rat and treadmill diagrams) }
	\label{fig: Michelson_morley}
\end{figure}

It did this by splitting a single light beam into two perpendicular paths, that are then reflected back to be recombined and sent towards a light detector. By rotating the whole interferometer setup, the two light paths could be aligned either parallel or perpendicular to the Earth’s motion through the presumed \hyperlink{def-aether}{aether}.
They reasoned that if the speed of light was constant with respect to the proposed \hyperlink{def-aether}{aether}, just like in the rat experiment from the previous section, the split light beams would recombine at different times. From the previous section's system of rats on a treadmill, we have the treadmill's platform as being analogous to the \hyperlink{def-aether}{aether}, and the rats as being analogous to the light, with both having the room that these experiments are done in as being the other inertial reference frames.
However, when Michelson and Morley performed the experiment, they found no difference in travel time to the detector for both paths, indicating that there was no difference in the speed of light in any direction in earth's \hyperlink{def-Reference-frame}{reference frame}. hence no dependence of light's speed on the supposed \hyperlink{def-aether}{aether}. This null result seriously discredited the \hyperlink{def-aether}{aether} theories and ultimately led to the proposal by Einstein in 1905 that the speed of light (in a \hyperlink{def-vacuum}{vacuum}) is a universal constant and is independent of the motion of the \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} or source. And to allow for us to have this universal speed of light (in a \hyperlink{def-vacuum}{vacuum}), it will require us to change our ideas of how time and positions are perceived by different \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}s.

\section{Speed of Light}% as a Constant}

The experiments showed light does not have a medium that it travels at a constant velocity relative to, but instead travels at a constant velocity in a \hyperlink{def-vacuum}{vacuum} in all \hyperlink{def-Reference-frame}{reference frame}s, independent of how fast the source of that light is moving in the frame, e.g. a moving truck's headlights. Light only moves slower in objects such as glass due to being impeded by the interactions between it and the material it is traveling through.

Light itself moves extremely fast compared to any other everyday speeds we are used to (roughly 300 000 000 m/s, it can travel the diameter of the world in the blink of an eye). This is why we do not notice any delay in things we see around us in everyday life, though we should keep in mind that there is this delay, e.g. the light we see from the sun was emitted by it eight minutes ago for it to reach us now, and the further an object is located from us, the further back in time we are seeing it because of this delay.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=8cm]{images/pdf/lorry_torch.pdf}
	\caption{A diagram, showing light emitted from a truck in two different \protect\hyperlink{def-Reference-frame}{reference frame}s, with the emitted light having the same speed in each frame, though with different frequencies/energies due to the \protect\hyperlink{def-doppler-effect}{Doppler effect}, which will be explained later.}
	\label{fig: truck torch}
\end{figure}

When we look at the same truck setup as the previous sections, but in a \hyperlink{def-vacuum}{vacuum} this time, where the cannon firing a cannonball is swapped for the headlights emitting light, it gives the same speed of light when measured relative to the truck or the road, but how can this be true?

For this to be true, we need a new way of thinking about velocity addition, since the velocities of objects have to be added in a way that is consistent with the requirement that the speed of light is constant, but also gives the approximate classical addition at speeds of objects at much less than the speed of light, like how we observe with the cannon and truck. Since the speed of the light depends only on the units of time and positions, the only way to correct for this is to have the measured positions and times of objects \hyperlink{def-transform}{transform} differently when swapping between \hyperlink{def-Reference-frame}{reference frame}s than the classical way. This is what we will talk about next.
For the curious, it was the \href{https://scienceready.com.au/pages/determination-of-speed-of-light}{experiment by Ole Rømer} that showed that light traveled at a finite speed rather than being instantaneously emitted and received.

\section{Positions and Time}

%███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████
\subsection{Time Dilation}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=8cm]{images/pdf/lorry_clock.pdf}
	\caption{Diagram showing the extra distance light travels in the road's frame with the truck moving.}
	\label{fig: truck clock}
\end{figure}

Let's imagine a simple clock, as shown in Figure \ref{fig: truck clock}, made of a light pulse moving back and forth between two mirrors on a moving truck, with a mirror on the truck’s floor and on the roof directly above it, we will keep time by taking a tick of this clock to be when the light travels from one mirror to the other mirror and back again. For an \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} in the truck, they will see the light go straight up and down between the mirrors, but an \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} stationary relative to the road will see not just the light traveling up and down but also with the direction of the truck as well, hence it will travel a longer distance. But since the distance traveled by the light in the moving frame is longer and the speed of light is constant, we are only left with the possibility that the perceived travel time of the light has to be longer in this \hyperlink{def-Reference-frame}{reference frame}, i.e. the clock ticks slower to the \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} on the road watching the moving truck. How much it is moving slower, can be solved using the ratio of the lengths of paths in each frame as they are shown in the diagram. This difference in the flow of time will later lead to more odd consequences. The slowing of the ticking is also the same for any type of clock, and if you were to play a movie on the truck, it would take a longer amount of time for it to play through from the roads \hyperlink{def-Reference-frame}{reference frame}, it is the actual time itself being slowed down.

Also the closer the truck goes to the speed of light, the bigger the difference in how fast time flows relative to the truck's time (this can be seen as a longer horizontal stretch in the path taken for the light from the perspective of someone standing still on the road).

% This section has so far assumed that the distances between the mirrors are not changed due to it being in perpendicular directions to the motion of the truck, which will be addressed in a later section

%███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████
\subsection{Simultaneity}

%so events that happen simultaneously in different locations to an observer in the truck, happen at different times according to the road observer. this is the consequence of the need for the speed of light to be constant for each observer.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=8cm]{images/pdf/lorry_simul.pdf}
	\caption{A diagram showing how the two \protect\hyperlink{def-event}{event}s of light reaching the two walls of the truck are \protect\hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneous} in one frame but happen at different times in another, due to truck's movement in the second frame and the speed of light remaining the same.}
	\label{fig: truck simultaneity}
\end{figure}

Let's imagine a truck in its \hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{rest frame}, with a light bulb in the middle and mirrors on the front and back walls, now if the light bulb gives off a pulse of light, the light will travel from the center of the truck to reach the mirrors \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneously} and back to the light bulb also \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneously}.
But the \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} on the road watching the truck drive past will see the light bulb \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneously} emit light in both directions and also \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneously} return to the bulb again. However, to do this the light reflects off each wall's mirrors at different times in this frame as shown in the diagram. This is because the speed of light is the same for both directions but the truck is moving, meaning the back of the truck is moving towards where the bulb was when the pulse was emitted making the distances traveled shorter, and due to the front wall moving away from it, the light travels a longer distance to get to the front wall. Due to this and the speed of light being the same in both \hyperlink{def-Reference-frame}{reference frame}s, the \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} on the road will see the light hit the mirrors at different times.
So, times of \hyperlink{def-event}{event}s (like when the light reaches either mirror) are different for \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}s in different \hyperlink{def-Reference-frame}{reference frame}s, there is no one true order of \hyperlink{def-event}{event}s, e.g. an \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} in a faster-moving truck moving in an opposite direction would see the light reach the front wall first.
However for all \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}s the light will return to the central light bulb \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneously}. If two \hyperlink{def-event}{event}s happen in the same position at the same time (i.e. the light returning to the center of the light bulb \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneously}) then this happens \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneously} in all frames of reference.

I have left out any mention of \hyperlink{def-length-contraction}{length contraction}, which will be introduced in the next section, and why it needs to be equal in both directions from the lightbulb, i.e. for the light to \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneously} return to the light bulb they need to maintain equal distances of the walls from the central light bulb.

\subsection{Length Contraction}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=8cm]{images/pdf/Full_Lorry_Transform.pdf}
	\caption{A diagram, showing a truck with a square container in its \protect\hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{rest frame} (top), emitting light from a central bulb in the four directions, with all light being reflected by the mirrored sides back to the center. In the second frame with the truck now moving (bottom) we see the truck's length contracted and what the light paths would be in this frame}
	\label{fig: full truck transform}
\end{figure}

If we have a truck in its \hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{rest frame} with a square container with light emitted in all four directions from the center so that it will bounce off the mirrored sides of the truck and return to the center \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneously}. we require that in the moving frame they also all return to the center \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneously}, as multiple \hyperlink{def-event}{event}s that happen at a single point \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneously} in one frame, must happen \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneously} in all other frames. This time between the light being emitted and absorbed will be the \hyperlink{def-time-dilation}{dilated time}, that was described in the \hyperlink{def-time-dilation}{time dilation} section.

To achieve this \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneity} in the return of the light to the bulb, the length of the path of light in each direction has to be the same (as its speed is the same in all directions), we can work out the length of the upward path from the \hyperlink{def-time-dilation}{time dilation} section, and this is the length the path needs to be in the horizontal directions as well, the paths can only have this length if the truck length is contracted when moving, the exact amount of contraction can be worked geometrically, and it turns out that the ratio of the increase in the amount of time that passes before the light is reabsorbed is inversely proportional to the amount the truck is contracted in the direction of its movement.

i.e. time passes by a factor slower in the moving frame, and the change in distances in the direction of movement are inversely proportional to the same factor.

The reason that we do not worry about contraction in the distance between the floor and ceiling mirrors, will be explained in a later section.

%... the faster you go the closer things are in that frame, so it would take a shorter amount of time to get to places the closer you get to the speed of light (is this true)

\subsubsection{3 car system way of explaining length contraction (may delete)}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=8cm]{images/pdf/cars.pdf}
	\caption{Diagram that illustrates an experiment with three cars initially at rest and equally spaced on a road. The middle car emits light that reaches the front and back cars \protect\hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneously}, triggering all cars to accelerate for a predetermined amount of time. Now another light is emitted from the middle car after the acceleration has finished, the road \protect\hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} sees the light reach the back car first, as it is moving towards where the light had been emitted, this causes it to begin accelerating before the front car. This results in the cars being closer together after acceleration, demonstrating Lorentz \protect\hyperlink{def-length-contraction}{length contraction}, However, to the car \protect\hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}, the distance between the cars remains unchanged from the initial distances.}
	\label{fig: cars}
\end{figure}

Say we have 3 cars that are equally distanced and at rest on the road, the middle car sends out a pulse of light that reaches the front and back car at the same time to the road \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} and the \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}s in the car when it reaches them both, all the cars accelerate for a predetermined fixed amount of time, so that after this acceleration period the cars are now moving but still equally spaced relative to the \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}s in the cars and the \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} on the road. As for all \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}s the light reaches the front and back cars at the same time.

Now if we do this a second time, with the middle car releasing another pulse, we have in the frame of the \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}s in the cars: again the front and back drivers receiving the pulses at the same time meaning that they again will start accelerating simultaneously, and again after the acceleration there will be the same equal distance between the cars. But for the \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} on the road, they see the back car receive the signal first as that car is moving towards the point where the light pulse was emitted and the front car is moving away from it. This would mean the back car would start accelerating first to get to the final constant velocity and get closer to the front car before the front car begins to accelerate, hence the cars end up closer together after all of this. The \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}s in the car and the road \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}, do not agree with what the distances between the cars are. This contraction of length between cars, in the frame in which the cars are moving, is called Lorentz \hyperlink{def-length-contraction}{length contraction}, which means that objects that are moving faster become shorter, and the distances between the objects also become shorter.

So we require that there is no change in size perpendicular to the movement of the object.}

%Suppose we have a ball at rest in a pipe such that the ball just touches the inner circumference of the pipe, if we were to now make the ball move we would have it Lorentz contracted along the direction of the movement, but if we also had it contract perpendicular to the direction of movement then in the rest frame of the pipe we would have the ball smaller such that it no longer was touching the inner pipe, but if we changed to the frame of the ball it would be the pipe that was moving and we would expect the pipe to contract and be smaller than the ball (so that the ball would get stuck), so in the two different frames we would have two contradictory outcomes, but we should be able to go from one frame to the other and not have these contradictions, so to have this we require that there is no change in size perpendicular to the movement of the object.

\section{Doppler Effect}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=10cm]{images/pdf/Doppler.pdf}
	\caption{A diagram showing (left) a central source at rest emitting several circular pulses of light with equal time between each pulse, (right) the same source in a frame where it is now moving and emitting circular pulses of light, but each subsequential pulse is emitted from a different position as the source is moving, marked by a faded dot}
	\label{fig: doppler effect intro}
\end{figure}

If we have a source at rest, emitting circular pulses of light with equal times between each pulse, we will have concentric circular pulses in this frame, but if we move to a frame where the source is now moving to the right, each circular pulse is now being emitted from a different position as the source is moving. Due to the source moving, each pulse will be emitted closer to the right-hand side of the previous pulses, creating a bunching up of the pulses (increase in frequency) in the direction of movement and a spreading out (decrease in frequency) of the pulses in the opposite direction, that is what happens in the classical version of the \hyperlink{def-doppler-effect}{Doppler effect}, that you will notice that an ambulance or police car sounds different driving towards you and when driving away, this is due to the bunching up of the sounds waves in the direction of the moving vehicle. In special relativity, we also have to take the \hyperlink{def-time-dilation}{time dilation} of the pulses into account, as there will be a longer time between each subsequential circular pulse, Due to perceived time moving more slowly for objects moving relative to the \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}, this has a decreasing effect on the frequency in all directions, but directly in the direction of movement of the source this is outweighed by the frequency increase from the previous bunching up effect. Since the energy of the light is proportional to the frequency it is increased in the direction of motion of the source due to the \hyperlink{def-doppler-effect}{Doppler effect}s and decreased in the opposite direction.

One thing not mentioned yet in this picture so far is how the light is also affected by what is called the \hyperlink{def-aberration}{aberration}, which is the change in the direction of each part of the emitted light pulse, which leads to light not being circularly symmetric in each of the spherical pulses, which will be explained in the next section.

\section{Aberration}

The picture painted of the \hyperlink{def-doppler-effect}{Doppler effect} in the previous section has yet to show the effect on the angular distribution of the light in each of the spherical pulses. Here we will show that there is also a higher concentration of light in the direction of the source's movement, as shown in Figure \ref{fig: truck aberrated}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

	\label{fig: truck aberrated}
\end{figure}

\iffalse javascript{Aberration} \fi

With the help of the previous \hyperlink{def-length-contraction}{length contraction} section, let's imagine a truck with a spherical container with mirrored walls, a central bulb emits light in all directions, in the \hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{rest frame} all light reaches the spherical wall at the same time and returns to the center bulb \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneously}.
Then in the moving frame, we have the spherical container \hyperlink{def-length-contraction}{length contracted} and the light moving at the same speed but reflecting off the walls at different times, returning to the center bulb simultaneously, for this to be true, the directions of the light have to be aberrated in the way shown in the diagram to allow for this \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneous} return to the bulb.

From the diagrams, you can see how light is aberrated when emitted from a moving source relative to its \hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{rest frame} and also when being absorbed by a source, the faster the source is moving, the more the direction of each part of the light pulse is aberrated.

If the speed of the source was to approach the speed of light, all emitted light would approach the direction of movement of the source, if the source was theoretically able to reach the speed of light, all light would be emitted in the direction of the source but also move at the same speed of the source, i.e. the source would move with the emitted light and it would not leave the vicinity of the source. Though the rate at which it emits it would also tend to zero. If a photon theoretically had mass and its influence of the gravitational force moved at the speed of light, then we would not be able to feel any gravitational effects outside the vicinity of it, due to all of its gravitational field being propagated in the direction of its movement and at the same speed as the photon.

Also in astrophysics, it has to be taken into account that the earth's view of the universe is distorted by \hyperlink{def-aberration}{aberration}, as shown in diagram ref{...} *** diagram of earth's view of the universe is distorted from the \hyperlink{def-aberration}{aberration} (example on wiki) ***

\section{Relativistic Beaming}

If we now take both the Doppler picture and the \hyperlink{def-aberration}{aberration} picture from the previous sections together, so that if we have a source that in its \hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{rest frame} is emitting a spherical pulse of light with evenly distributed angles. Then in a frame with the source now moving, we will have this spherical pulse's wavelength bunched up in the direction of movement (giving a change in the color of the light), with the angular spread of the light at a higher concentration in the direction of the movement of the source.

\subsection{Retarded Field}

If we were to have multiple pulses with a constant time between each pulse, and remembering that each pulses origin was from a point in the source's past position (the \hyperlink{def-retarded-position}{retarded position}  of the source), we can work out what the full view of all the pulses in the \hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{rest frame} is in the moving frame, shown in Figure \ref{fig: full field transformation 1}. From this, we can work out the distribution and hence concentration of the light for any moving source relative to that of it at rest.

\subsection{Perceived vs Actual Speed}

Imagine that a ball one light year (the distance it takes light to travel in a year) away, is fired directly towards you. It will take one year for the first light from the oncoming ball to reach you. If the ball moves at three-quarters of the speed of light, the ball will hit you in four-thirds of a year (a year and four months) after it is fired. The last light from the ball will reach you just as the ball hits you. As you see it, the time between the first and last light from the ball is four months. During those four months, you will see the ball start at its initial position and travel a distance of one light-year. So the ball appears to you to have been moving three times faster than light. This is just how it appears to the \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} due to the delay in the light signal/the retarded view of the system, leading to latency in how the system is observed.
%*** from relativity visualized book:

This shows how important it is to take the delay in the light from objects into account when observing relativistic systems, this view is called the delayed/retarded view, i.e what we see now are objects in their past positions, and the further things are from you the further into the past we are currently seeing them.

\section{Velocity Transformation}

Previously, we explored how velocities at the speed of light change between different frames of reference, that is their directions are aberrated, However, for objects moving at speeds less than light, we need the transforming speeds to be different as well as aberrated due to the \hyperlink{def-transform}{transform} needing to tend towards the classical \hyperlink{def-transform}{transform} as the speeds tend towards zero. To understand these velocity \hyperlink{def-transform}{transformation}s, we will need to first delve into the mathematical details which will be covered in later chapters.

%*** Javascript can redo truck diagrams but with speeds less than that of light, and have the time between emission and absorption being same, but speeds and direction of pulse changing depending on rest direction

%*** javascript Diagram could have an animated polar graph of how velocities change for low and fast velocities and frame changes *** could show classical addition of velocities in it too, either as an overlay, beside it, or using button

\section{The More Abstract Properties...}% of Momentum, Energy and Mass}

The \hyperlink{def-transform}{transformation} of more abstract quantities that depend on position and time, such as momentum, energy, and mass do not have a simple visual interpretation, and this is the point at which the mathematics is needed for a proper understanding of how they transform. With the maths, you will find new conservation of momentum and energy laws.

%*** could talk about what happens to the quantities without saying why

%This also means that it is impossible to get any particle with mass up to the speed of light, as the closer the particle gets to the speed of light, the heavier it is perceived and therefore keeps requiring a greater and greater force to accelerate it, This amount of perceived mass tends to infinity and the force required to accelerate it would also tend to infinity.\newline

%***
%(diagram)
%If we have two balls roll to the center of a truck at rest and hit each other and stick, giving zero overall momentum as both ball's momentum cancels each other out, but to the observer on the road the stuck-together balls move with the truck, so the ball at the back of the truck must have more momentum before the collision...
%*** So far this is also true for classical frame transform

%From before we have that the consequence of the different times and coordinates is that if a moving object emits light, to allow the speed of light to stay constant, the transform will also have the consequence of changing the frequency of the light, and hence its energy.

%Since energy is measured in units of position and time (as well as mass) the energy of a particle and systems in different frames have to go through transformations themselves, which leads to the famous energy and mass equivalence equation E=mc2 (this is the reduced form of the equation)\newline

%From finding how the momentum changes between 2 frames due to the Lorentz transformations we find a relation between the Mass of a particle and how much energy this particle is equivalent to, i.e. if a particle with a certain mass annihilates with its anti-particle, it gives out photons, corresponding to the energy of the particle which is different whether it is at rest or moving, as the perceived mass of a particle increases the faster it moves\newline

%*** mass is not increased only the apparent mass

%This and the previous sections will also lead to changes in how we treat acceleration and forces, but these, unfortunately, have no simple visualization for how they are transformed between frames.

\section{Summary}

A key early idea was that light traveled through a medium called the luminiferous aether. The Michelson-Morley experiment attempted to measure Earth's motion relative to this aether. Surprisingly, no difference was found in the speed of light regardless of direction. This conflicted with the intuitive addition of velocities, discredited the aether theory, and led Einstein to propose light's constant speed in all frames as a fundamental principle.

Special relativity emerged from the insight that light's speed in a vacuum is constant for all observers, regardless of the light source's speed relative to each observer. This required rethinking the concepts of time intervals and distances between points to accommodate light's fixed speed and led to the requirement that a clock moving relative to an observer ticks slower from the observer's perspective while also being contracted in the direction of its motion. This was shown in figure \ref{fig: truck clock} and figure \ref{fig: full truck transform}.

It also led to the \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneity} of events not being absolute, e.g. light emitted from the middle of a moving truck reaches the front and back walls at the same time as someone at rest in the truck. But someone standing still on the road sees the light hit both walls at different times, as shown in figure \ref{fig: truck simultaneity}. There is no universal "now" at a distance - observers relate events differently.

Classical physics provides an excellent approximation of reality at low speeds. Relativistic effects only become readily noticeable at speeds approaching that of light. We don't normally experience them because motions in everyday life are very slow relative to that of light which is roughly three hundred million metres per second. The faster an object moves relative to an observer, the more its lengths contract and its time dilates, to the observer.

When it comes to velocities, they combine differently than in classical physics. However, we must ensure that the transforms reduce to the intuitive addition of velocities of classical physics at low speeds while accommodating light's constant rate in all frames of reference. This leads to initially bizarre outcomes like \textbf{apparent} faster-than-light motion emerging from how relativistic optical effects play out across distances, due to the delay in light signals from objects at a distance. Nevertheless, special relativity gives a truer, more accurate picture of reality.

We also have seen that light's frequencies shift when emitted from a moving source due to space-time effects on wave propagation (the Doppler effect) and that light concentrates in the direction of the source's motion, the aberrational effect. Both together intensely focus light and radiation in the direction of rapidly moving objects, relativistic beaming.

These effects will all be explained more fully with math in the coming chapters, along with other effects that require the use of math to fully understand, as well as new conservation laws of energy, mass, and momentum. We will derive everything step by step starting with the transformation of positions and times between reference frames.

*** Explain what a photon sees, i.e. when it is emitted it sees a universe that is infinitely thin in direction of movement and the time between emission and absorption is then zero

\chapter{Positions, Time and Velocity} %The Math Begins:

Now that we have learned about the basic concepts of special relativity, we can let the mathematics begin, starting with classical relativity as a starting point, it will give us an understanding of how to \hyperlink{def-transform}{transform} between \hyperlink{def-Reference-frame}{reference frame}s, we can then compare special relativity to this to help with our intuition.

\section{Classical Relativity}

For classical (Galilean) relativity, if we have two \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}s moving relative to each other at constant velocity and want to find how each \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} would describe the positions and motion of a particle relative to them, we need to know the positions and times in one observer's frame and how to \hyperlink{def-transform}{transform} them into the other \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}s frame. i.e. if we have how one \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} would describe the coordinates of a particle over time relative to them and we want to now know the coordinates of the particle with respect to the other \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}, we need to know how the transformation of coordinates works.

Before special relativity, it was assumed that distances between two positions were the same for all \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}s, i.e. the first \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} would see a stick and measure it to be the same length as another \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} moving relative to them would measure it to be. long story short, lengths are the same for all \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}s in \hyperlink{def-galilean-transform}{Galilean transform}. Another assumption is that time is constant for everyone, i.e. clocks move at the same rate for each \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} and if a particle was to emit light at a particular time. This light would be emitted at the same time for the other \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}s too.

So let's see how the mathematics works for the classical coordinate system transform between two \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}s. If we have the coordinate system in one \hyperlink{def-Inertial-reference-frame}{inertial reference frame} $<S>$ to describe an \hyperlink{def-event}{event} $E$, which is given by the set of spatial and time coordinates $(x,y,z)$ and $t$, and we want to find the coordinates of the event in another "primed" \hyperlink{def-Inertial-reference-frame}{inertial reference frame}/coordinate system that is moving at a relative speed $v$ to the first frame in the z-axis, that was initially overlapping with the first frame at time $t=0$, with the events coordinates now described by $x', y', z'$ at time $t'$. The direction of the second frame is in the upwards z-direction instead of being to the right in the case of the truck diagrams from the previous chapter, this is to help us when we use spherical polar coordinates later and to help see the symmetries.

	\caption{Diagram, of a \protect\hyperlink{def-Reference-frame}{reference frame} $<S>$ with its associated $(x,y,z)$ coordinate system at rest in this frame, it also shows a primed coordinate axis $(x', y', z')$ at time $t=t'$ from when the axis where overlapping, associated with another \protect\hyperlink{def-Inertial-reference-frame}{inertial reference frame}s moving at velocity $v$ in the z-axis, it shows an \protect\hyperlink{def-event}{event} with position vector $\overrightarrow{OE}$ in this frame and the vector $\overrightarrow{OO'}$ to this primed axis origin and the vector $\overrightarrow{O'E}$ which is the vector from this primed origin to the \protect\hyperlink{def-event}{event} in the shown frame.}
	\label{simple Galilean transform derivation}
\end{figure}

For frame $<S>$ we have its origin $O$ and an \hyperlink{def-event}{event} $E$ located at

\begin{equation}
	\overrightarrow{OE}=(x,y,z)
\end{equation}

at time $t$ from axis overlap, and a prime frame $<S'>$'s origin $O'$ moving at relative velocity $v$ so that in the original frame we have after a time

\begin{equation}
	\overrightarrow{OO'}=(0,0,vt)
\end{equation}

in $<S'>$ we have the \hyperlink{def-event}{event}'s coordinates as

\begin{equation}
	\overrightarrow{O'E} = ( x', y', z' ) = \overrightarrow{OE} - \overrightarrow{OO'}  = (x,y,z-vt)
	\label{eq: classical event}
\end{equation}

for frame $<S>$ we have

\begin{equation}
	\overrightarrow{OE} = (x,y,z) = \overrightarrow{OO'} + \overrightarrow{O'E} = (x',y',z'+vt')
	\label{eq: classical event 2}
\end{equation}

so we have $x=x'$, $y=y'$, $t=t'$ (time is assumed to be the same across reference frames in classical relativity), and for the z-components

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		 & z' = z - vt \\
		 & z = z'+vt'
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

This shows the symmetry between the frames, as if we were originally in the $<S'>$ frame we would have the $<S>$ frame moving at -$v$ relative to it, so we would expect that the inverse \hyperlink{def-transform}{transformation} would replace one frame's coordinates with the other and have the opposite \hyperlink{def-frame-velocity}{frame velocity} instead.
So the inverse of going from \hyperlink{def-Primed-Frame}{primed frame} to original is just a matter of swapping all primed coordinates with original coordinates and changing the sign on the \hyperlink{def-frame-velocity}{frame velocity}, this can be seen from starting at time $t=0$ we have the frame's origins overlapping and that there is a symmetry from here, we have the freedom to choose either frame to be the original, as no frame is particularly special and depending which one you pick the relative velocity is either $v$ or -$v$.

The full description of the position and time \hyperlink{def-transform}{transform} for an \hyperlink{def-event}{event} is given as

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		 & x'=x               \\
		 & y'=y               \\
		 & z' = z-vt          \\
		\text{at time \ \ \ } \\
		 & t'= t
	\end{aligned}

\section{Postulates of Special Relativity}

\begin{tcolorbox}[breakable]
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The laws of physics are the same in all \hyperlink{def-Inertial-reference-frame}{inertial frames of reference} (i.e. if an \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} carries out an experiment in an \hyperlink{def-Inertial-reference-frame}{inertial reference frame}, there would be no difference if the experiment was instead carried out within a different \hyperlink{def-Inertial-reference-frame}{inertial reference frame})
		\item The speed of light in a \hyperlink{def-vacuum}{vacuum} is the same in all inertial/non-accelerating frames of reference.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

They are not the only assumptions, you may notice some small jumps in the logic when it comes to the derivation. But be aware small miss understandings have thrown people down the special relativity rabbit hole when trying to find inconsistencies or prove it wrong, throughout I will try to leave as few logical gaps as possible, and explain as simply and as in-depth as possible so that you do not do this yourself.

\section{Derivations}% from Time Dilation and Length Contraction}
For the derivation of the coordinate transformation between two inertial frames, we will follow a similar line of thought as we did in the first chapter on the conceptual introduction. For those who are curious, there is an alternative derivation using spherical light pulses given in Appendix \ref{spherical light pulse derivation}.

\subsection{Time Dilation}

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=10cm]{images/pdf/Light_clock.pdf}
	\caption{A diagram showing a clock keeping time using light, light is emitted from the origin and reflected off a mirror back to the origin, shown here in two different frames (describe what things are in the diagram)(need axis labels)}
	\label{fig: light clock}
\end{figure}

We can have a clock that keeps time using a light pulse being emitted from a bulb towards a mirror and back again, recording a tick on its clock each time it returns to where it was emitted, taking a time $\Delta \tau$ in the rest frame to return. The distance the light travels to the mirror and back in this time is

\begin{equation}
	2W=c\Delta \tau,
\end{equation}

the distance the bulb travels during this in the moving frame is

\begin{equation}
	L=u\Delta t' = -v \Delta t',
\end{equation}

where $\Delta t'$ is the time it took light to return in moving frame and $u$ is the speed of the bulb which is in the opposite direction of the \hyperlink{def-Primed-Frame}{primed frame} relative to the \hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{proper frame}, i.e. $u=-v$, the distance light travels in this time is

\begin{equation}
	2D = c \Delta t' ,
\end{equation}

this forms a triangle, so we have the square of the hypotenuse $2D$ equal to the square of the lengths $W$ and $L$:

\begin{equation}
	c^2 \Delta t'^2 = v^2 \Delta t'^2 + c^2\Delta \tau^2
\end{equation}

rearranging to find the time it took in the \hyperlink{def-Primed-Frame}{primed frame} relative to the time in the \hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{proper frame}, we find

\begin{equation}
	\Delta t' = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1-\dfrac{v^2}{c^2}}} \Delta \tau = \gamma \Delta \tau
\end{equation}

with

\begin{equation}
	\gamma =  \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1-\dfrac{v^2}{c^2}}}.
\end{equation}

which means

\begin{equation}
	\Delta t' \geq \Delta \tau
\end{equation}

So we take this outcome as the time taken between two \hyperlink{def-event}{event}s in the same position in the moving frame taking longer than in the \hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{rest frame} of the clock, due to the longer distance it has to travel at the same speed.

\subsection{Length Contraction TODO}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=10cm]{images/pdf/Length_Contraction.pdf}
	\caption{A diagram, showing a central bulb emitting light in the three directions, with all light being reflected by the mirrors back to the center, this is shown at rest on the left and moving in another inertial frame with the system now moving, with its length slightly contracted in the direction of movement.}
	\label{fig: length contraction math}
\end{figure}

If we have a system in its rest frame with light emitted in three directions from the center, one directly in front and the other two to the sides, with equally distanced mirrors in the three directions so that they will be reflected back and return to the center simultaneously. we require that in the moving frame they also all return to the center simultaneously, as multiple events that happen at a single point simultaneously in one frame, must happen simultaneously in all other frames. This time between the light being emitted and absorbed will be the dilated time from the previous section. To achieve this simultaneity in the return of the light to the bulb, the length of the full path of light from there center to the mirrors and back in each direction has to be the same (as its speed of light is the same in all directions and the return time has to be the same), we can work out the length of the sideways paths from the time dilation section, and this is the length the path needs to be in the vertical directions as well, the paths can only have this length if the system length is contracted when moving in the direction of movement. Note that there is no contraction in the perpendicular direction to the movement due to the paradox explained in chapter \ref{width contraction}.

The pulse sent forward has a distance

\begin{equation}
	L_1= ct'_1= D' + ut'_1
\end{equation}

to travel to get to the mirror that is moving away from the point it was emitted, where $t'_1$ is the time taken to get there and $D'$ is the distance between the mirror in front and the bulb and $u$ being the speed the bulb and mirrors are moving in the primed frame. After this, the light then has to travel back to the bulb a distance

\begin{equation}
	L_2 = ct'_2= D' - ut'_2
\end{equation}

where $t'_2$ is the time taken to return to the bulb from the mirror, both of these give the two times as

\begin{equation}
	t'_1=\frac{D'}{c-u}
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
	t'_2=\frac{D'}{c+u}
\end{equation}

adding both times together gives the total primed time

\begin{equation}
	t' = D'(\frac{1}{c+u} + \frac{1}{c-u})=\frac{D'}{c}\frac{1}{1-u^2/c^2} =\frac{D'}{c}\frac{1}{1-v^2/c^2}=\gamma^2 \frac{D'}{c}
\end{equation}

from the time dilation equation, we have

\begin{equation}
	ct'=c\gamma t = \gamma D = \gamma^2 D'
\end{equation}

and finally leading to the contracted distance to the front mirror in the primed frame being

\begin{equation}
	D' = \frac{1}{\gamma}D
\end{equation}

so we have

\begin{equation}
	D' \leq D
\end{equation}

we take from this that distances in the direction of movement of an object are contracted in its direction of movement compared to the rest frame of the object.

	\caption{A diagram showing an \protect\hyperlink{def-event}{event} in a frame with another primed frame's axis shown moving in the z-direction.}
	\label{fig: simple Lorentz transform derivation}
\end{figure}

If we are in a frame $<S>$ with origin $O$ at position $(0,0,0)$ and a primed frame $<S'>$ moving in the z-direction at velocity $v$ such that the position of the primed origin in this frame is

\begin{equation}
	\overrightarrow{OO'}=(0,0,vt)
\end{equation}

at time $t$ from when the origins overlapped, if there is an \hyperlink{def-event}{event} (let's say light or another object reaching a mirror that is moving with the \hyperlink{def-Primed-Frame}{primed frame}s axis) described in this frames coordinates as

\begin{equation}
	E = (x,y,z,t)
\end{equation}

with the spatial coordinates shown in the diagram as

\begin{equation}
	\overrightarrow{OE}=(x,y,z)
\end{equation}

in the primed frame we have the event described as

\begin{equation}
	E' = (x',y',z',t')
\end{equation}

now in the current frame, we have the \hyperlink{def-Primed-Frame}{primed frame}'s axis moving with the mirror, from the previous chapter we should have this primed distance in the z-direction to the event contracted, as the primed z-coordinates are contracted in this frame, as seen from length contraction section; the events z-coordinate is $z=z'/\gamma$, so that distance between the primes origin and the event in this frame (not the primed frame) is

\begin{equation}
	\overrightarrow{O'E} = (x,y,z'/\gamma)
\end{equation}

noting that we have the x and y-components unaffected due to the cannon and ball thought experiment from the first chapter. From the diagram, we can see

\begin{equation}
	\overrightarrow{OE}= \overrightarrow{OO'} + \overrightarrow{O'E}
	\label{eq: event}
\end{equation}

subbing each component into this equation for the z-direction and rearranging, we have

\begin{equation}
	z' = \gamma (z-vt)
\end{equation}

If we were instead in frame $<S'>$ we would have $\overrightarrow{OE}=(x,y,z/\gamma)$, $\overrightarrow{OO'}=(0,0,vt')$, and $\overrightarrow{O'E} = (x,y,z')$, doing the same for these we have

\begin{equation}
	z = \gamma (z'+vt')
\end{equation}

This should be expected as this shows the expected symmetry between the frames because if we were originally in the $<S'>$ frame we would have the $<S>$ frame moving instead at -$v$ in the z-direction relative to the $<S'>$ frame, so we would expect that the inverse \hyperlink{def-transform}{transformation} would replace one frame's coordinates with the other and have the negative of the velocity instead.
Now substituting the z transforms into each other we have

\begin{equation}
	z = \gamma ( \gamma (z-vt)+vt')
\end{equation}

and rearranging gives

\begin{equation}
	t' = \gamma \left( \left( \dfrac{1}{\gamma^2}-1 \right)\frac{z}{v} + t \right)
\end{equation}

with $\gamma^{-2}=1-v^2/c^2$ then giving

\begin{equation}
	t' = \gamma \left( t - \dfrac{vz}{c^2} \right)
\end{equation}

leaving full description of the location and time of an \hyperlink{def-event}{event} as

\begin{equation}
	\mhl{
		\begin{aligned}
			 & x'=x                                         \\
			 & y'=y                                         \\
			 & z' = \gamma (z-vt)                           \\
			\text{at time \ \ \ }                           \\
			 & t'=\gamma \bigg(t-\frac{vz}{c^2}\bigg)       \\
			\text{with \ \ \ }                              \\
			 & \gamma = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
		\end{aligned}
	}
	\label{eq: Lorentz transformation}
\end{equation}

For the time \hyperlink{def-transform}{transform} the $\frac{vz}{c^2}$ term is the cause of \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneous} \hyperlink{def-event}{event}s in one inertial frame no longer being \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneous} in another inertial frame, and the gamma factor $\gamma$, is the term that causes the overall change in how fast time flows relative in each frame. In the spatial coordinate transforms the gamma factor is the cause of the change of lengths in the direction of the frame's movement. How the transformation works is shown in figure \ref{fig: coordinate transform}.

	\includegraphics[width=10cm]{images/pdf/coordinate_transforms.pdf}

\subsection{Transforms with Low Relative Frame Speed Change}

For the coordinate transforms in the previous section we get back the classical \hyperlink{def-galilean-transform}{coordinates transform} for frame velocities much smaller than the speed of light, i.e. with $v\ll c$ we have $\gamma \approx 1$ we get

\begin{equation}
	t' \approx t
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	z' \approx z - vt
\end{equation}

which is the expected result for the \hyperlink{def-galilean-transform}{classical coordinates transform}, and what we are used to seeing things work in everyday life. The influence of the gamma factor is shown in figure \ref{fig: Gamma Factor}.

\section{Velocity}

from taking the infinitesimals of equations from eq. \eqref{eq: Lorentz transformation}, we have

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		 & dx'=dx                                    \\
		 & dy'=dy                                    \\
		 & dz' = \gamma (dz-vdt)                     \\
		 & dt'=\gamma \bigg(dt-\frac{vdz}{c^2}\bigg)
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

giving the velocities as

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		 & u'_x = \frac{dx'}{dt'}=\frac{dx}{\gamma \bigg(dt-\frac{vdz}{c^2}\bigg) }                \\
		 & u'_y = \frac{dy'}{dt'}=\frac{dy}{\gamma \bigg(dt-\frac{vdz}{c^2}\bigg) }                \\
		 & u'_z = \frac{dz'}{dt'} = \frac{\gamma (dz-vdt)}{\gamma \bigg(dt-\frac{vdz}{c^2}\bigg) }
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

now dividing the top and bottom of the fraction by $dt$ we can give the equations in their vector form as

\begin{equation}
	\label{vector velocity transform}
	\mhl{
		\begin{aligned}
			 & \mathbf{U'}_p = \dfrac{1}{\gamma\left(1- \dfrac{v}{c^2} u_z\right) }
			\begin{pmatrix}
				u_x                             \\
				u_y                             \\
				\gamma \left( u_z  - v  \right) \\
			\end{pmatrix}
			\\
			 & \text{at position $\mathbf{R'}$ and time $t'$ }
		\end{aligned}
	}
\end{equation}

the generalised velocity \hyperlink{def-transform}{transform} derived in appendix (todo) is

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{U'}_p  = \dfrac{1}{\gamma} \dfrac{\mathbf{U}_p + \Big[\dfrac{\gamma-1}{\|\mathbf{V}\|^2}(\mathbf{U}_p\cdot \mathbf{V})- \gamma \Big] \mathbf{V}}{1 - \dfrac{\mathbf{U}_p\cdot\mathbf{V}}{c^2}}
\end{equation}

with $\mathbf{V}$ being the frame's velocity in any generalized direction, instead of just being in the z-direction

\chapter{Observers Delayed World View}

Light travels extremely fast (roughly 300,000,000 m/s) compared to other everyday speeds we are used to. In the blink of an eye, light could travel around the world twice. We don't need to normally worry about the delay in the light signal, as the time to propagate the distances in our everyday world is very short, so the signal can be approximated as being instantaneous, therefore ignoring the more complex modeling of the delayed signal. But when it comes to particle physics or astronomy, we might be dealing with speeds close to that of light or also huge distances, e.g. light has taken 152,000 years to travel from the Andromeda galaxy, so we are currently seeing this galaxy where it was and how it looked 152,000 years ago. These past positions that we currently see are called the \hyperlink{def-retarded-position}{retarded position}s/delayed view positions.

\section{Relativistic Observers Delayed view}

When looking at moving objects we see them where they were in their past positions, due to the delay in the light signal, so let's talk about the \hyperlink{def-transform}{transform} showing a source particle emitting a photon to an \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}, showing the \hyperlink{def-retarded-position}{retarded position} the \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} sees.

\noindent
\textbf{system:} \\
If we take the \hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{rest frame} of an \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} and a particle that emits a pulse of light from its position at $\mathbf{R}$ so that it is received by the \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} at the origin, at time $t=0$.

The time the pulse of light was emitted is $T_{e}= -\frac{|\mathbf{R}|}{c}$ (were $\frac{|\mathbf{R}|}{c}$ is the time it takes light to propagate along $\mathbf{R}$ to the origin), and the velocity of that light that is propagating towards the origin is

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{c} = c
	\begin{pmatrix}
		0              \\
		\sin{\theta_c} \\
		\cos{\theta_c} \\
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

giving the emitted position as

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{R} =  c T_{e}
	\begin{pmatrix}
		0              \\
		\sin{\theta_c} \\
		\cos{\theta_c} \\
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

the position vector and light's velocity are in opposite directions which can be seen due to the emitted time being negative. If you wish to have this in terms of the position vector angle from the z-axis you can use the equation for the angles $\theta_{\scalebox{0.5}{R}} = \theta_c - \pi$. Now inputting the delayed positions and times (with origin time $t=0$) in the first frame into the coordinate transform we get the delayed position in the primed frame as

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\mathbf{R}'     & = cT_{e}
		\begin{pmatrix}
			0                                                  \\
			\sin{\theta_c}                                     \\
			\gamma \left( \cos{\theta_c} - \frac{v}{c} \right) \\
		\end{pmatrix}
		=
		\begin{pmatrix}
			0                                  \\
			R_y                                \\
			\gamma \left( R_z - vT_{e} \right) \\
		\end{pmatrix}
		\\
		\text{at time } &
		\\ T'_{e} & = \gamma (1-\frac{v}{c}  \cos{\theta_c} ) T_{e}
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

we can see that this does agree with the light's velocity \hyperlink{def-transform}{transform} as well, as it is in the direct opposite direction to $\mathbf{R}$ as it should be. With the light being received at the origin of the \hyperlink{def-Primed-Frame}{primed frame} axis at time $t'=0$, this is the delayed position, if you wanted to find the position of where the particle actually is, we would need to propagate this to the current time of zero of the observer, given by

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{R}'_{t'=0} = \mathbf{R}' - \mathbf{v}T'_{e} = cT_{e}
	\begin{pmatrix}
		0                                \\
		\sin{\theta_c}                   \\
		\frac{1}{\gamma}  \cos{\theta_c} \\
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

How the delayed view of coordinates is taken into account after a transformation is shown in the figure below.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=10cm]{images/pdf/coordinate_transforms_2.pdf}

	\caption{A diagram, showing an initial grid of points, representing position coordinates, at time $t=0$ that are at rest in their proper frame $<S>$, with an \protect\hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} at the origin (left), giving the direct transformation into the moving primed frame $<S'>$ (second) where the points are now moving at velocity $-v=-0.9$ which is in the negative z-direction with the colors and labels showing the desynchronization of the primed times $t'=- \gamma \frac{zv}{c^2}$, the next figure (third) shows what these points would be in the same primed frame when they are synchronized with the origin's time $t'=0$, the last figure (fourth) shows the same \protect\hyperlink{def-Primed-Frame}{primed frame} $<S'>$ but now with the particles positioned where they would be seen to be at by an \protect\hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} at the origin with the \protect\hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}s time $t'=0$, these positions are due to the delay in the light from these particles taking time to get to the \protect\hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}, also known as the \protect\hyperlink{def-retarded-position}{retarded position}s of the particles.}
	\label{fig: full coordinate transform}
\end{figure}

*** todo: could include the plot of a larger grid of points to show the distribution of delayed view of particles better, or give the heat map of the density of delayed view coordinates

\subsubsection{Delayed Coordinate Distribution and Density}

need to find the function for differential dz

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		 & \frac{dx}{dx'} = 1 \\
		 & \frac{dy}{dy'} = 1 \\
		 & \frac{dz}{dz'} =
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

*** todo: wanna get the relative delayed view proper coordinate density in the primed frame, there should also be a rotational aspect to it due to the non-uniform distribution of delayed proper coordinates

		{anchor=south west}{$\theta$}
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{Diagram of an axis showing spherical polar coordinates}
\end{figure}

For a given coordinate $\mathbf{R}$ we have the Cartesian coordinates $(x,y,z)$, but we can also write this in terms of spherical polar coordinates $(r,\theta,\phi)$ where the angles from the Z-Axis and X-axis respectively are $\theta$ (between 0 and $\pi$) and $\phi$ (between 0 and $2\pi$), and $r$ is the distance to the point from the origin, i.e. the magnitude $|\mathbf{R}|$. So that the coordinate can be written as

\begin{equation}
	\mhl{
		\mathbf{R} =
		\begin{pmatrix}
			x \\
			y \\
			z \\
		\end{pmatrix}
		= r
		\begin{pmatrix}
			\cos{\phi}\sin{\theta} \\
			\sin{\phi}\sin{\theta} \\
			\cos{\theta}           \\
		\end{pmatrix}
	}
\end{equation}

with $r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$, $\cos\phi= \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}$, and $\cos\theta=\frac{z}{r}$. Some useful formulae for later are the unit vectors

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{\hat{\text{$r$}}} =
	\begin{pmatrix}
		\sin\theta \, \cos\phi \\
		\sin\theta \, \sin\phi \\
		\cos\theta             \\
	\end{pmatrix},
	\mathbf{\hat{\text{$\theta$}}} =
	\begin{pmatrix}
		\cos\theta \, \cos\phi \\
		\cos\theta \, \sin\phi \\
		- \sin\theta           \\
	\end{pmatrix},
	\mathbf{\hat{\text{$\phi$}}} =
	\begin{pmatrix}
		- \, \sin\phi            \\
		\hphantom{-} \, \cos\phi \\
		0                        \\
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

and the differentials with respect to each of the coordinates are

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\frac{\partial\mathbf{R}}{\partial r}      & = \mathbf{\hat{\text{$r$}}} \\
		\frac{\partial\mathbf{R}}{\partial \theta} & =
		\begin{pmatrix}
			r \cos\theta  \cos\phi \\
			r \cos\theta  \sin\phi \\
			-r \sin\theta          \\
		\end{pmatrix}
		=r\mathbf{\hat{\text{$\theta$}}}                                         \\
		\frac{\partial\mathbf{R}}{\partial \phi}   & =
		\begin{pmatrix}
			-r \sin\theta  \sin\phi \\
			r \sin\theta  \cos\phi  \\
			0
		\end{pmatrix}
		= r \sin\theta \mathbf{\hat{\text{$\phi$}}}

\end{equation}

\section{Light Speed Velocity Transform}

The speed of light remains the same after transforming between frames, but the velocity is not as the direction changes. The velocity transformation in the case where the speed is that of light, $|u|=c$, with the direction in the initial frame at an angle $\alpha$ from the z-axis and $\varphi$ from the x-axis, so that in spherical polar coordinates the velocity of light is

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{c} = c
	\begin{pmatrix}
		\cos{\varphi}\sin{\alpha} \\
		\sin{\varphi}\sin{\alpha} \\
		\cos{\alpha}              \\
	\end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}

then from the velocity \hyperlink{def-transform}{transform} in Eq. \eqref{vector velocity transform} we get

% \begin{equation}
%     \begin{aligned}
%       & u'_x =\frac{c\sin\alpha\cos\varphi}{\gamma \bigg(1-\frac{v\cos\alpha}{c}\bigg) } \\ & u'_y =\frac{c\sin\alpha\sin\varphi}{\gamma \bigg(1-\frac{v\cos\alpha}{c}\bigg) } \\ & u'_z =\frac{c\cos\alpha -v}{ \bigg(1-\frac{v\cos\alpha}{c}\bigg) }
%     \end{aligned}
% \end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\label{light speed velocity transform}
	\mhl{
		\begin{aligned}
			 & \mathbf{c'} = \dfrac{c}{\gamma\left(1- \frac{v}{c} \cos\alpha\right) }
			\begin{pmatrix}
				\sin\alpha\cos\varphi                            \\
				\sin\alpha\sin\varphi                            \\
				\gamma \left( \cos\alpha  - \frac{v}{c}  \right) \\
			\end{pmatrix}
			\\
			 & \text{at position $\mathbf{R'}$ and time $t'$ }
		\end{aligned}
	}
\end{equation}

This still has the same speed of light which can be shown by taking the magnitude of the velocity vector (i.e. the square root of the squares of all of its elements). However, the angle of propagation has been changed. The reason I specified that this primed light speed is at position $\mathbf{R'}$ and time $t'$, was in case we are dealing non-constant angles.

	\caption{primed velocities of a evenly distributed pulse of light in \protect\hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{rest frame} of the source}
	%\label{fig: label}
\end{figure}

say about particles approaching the speed of light, emitting light only in the direction it is moving, at the speed it is moving

*** some diagrams with inward coming light ***
and what math has changed from before

The propagation directions of the light as seen in figure (REF), are transformed such that the angles between them and the Z-Axis, have the aberrational relationship

\begin{equation}
	\label{Cosine transform}
	\mhl{
	\cos\theta' = \frac{\mathbf{U}'_z}{\|\mathbf{U}'\|} \equiv \frac{\mathbf{R}'_{z}}{\|\mathbf{R}'\|} =  \dfrac{\cos\theta + \dfrac{u_p}{c}}{1+\dfrac{u_p}{c}\cos\theta}.
	}
\end{equation}

This is the relativistic aberration formula \cite{einstein1905electrodynamics}, it shows how the field's propagation direction transforms

	\label{fig: Retarded field outward field transform}
\end{figure}

As visualized in figure (\ref{fig: Retarded field outward field transform}). If we have a light source particle $p$, in its \hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{rest frame} that had emitted a pulse of light in one such that it propagates along $\mathbf{R}_{prop}=\mathbf{c}t_{prop}$ at an angle $\theta$ from the z-axis and is currently at position $\mathbf{R}$ at time $t=0$, where $\mathbf{c}$ is the velocity of light and $t_{prop}$ is the time it took to propagate to $\mathbf{R}$.
This system is then transformed as follows; the coordinate $\mathbf{R}$ is transformed to

\begin{equation}
	\label{displacement transform}
	\mathbf{R'} =
	\begin{pmatrix}
		x        \\
		y        \\
		\gamma z \\
	\end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}

the light pulse's velocity using eq. (REF) in Cartesian coordinates and particles speed in the \hyperlink{def-Primed-Frame}{primed frame} $u_p=-v$

\begin{equation}
	\label{light pulse velocity transform}
	\mathbf{c'} =  \dfrac{c}{\text{\AA}}
	\begin{pmatrix}
		\frac{x}{\|\mathbf{R}\|}                                        \\
		\frac{y}{\|\mathbf{R}\|}                                        \\
		\gamma \left( \frac{z}{\|\mathbf{R}\|} + \dfrac{u_p}{c} \right) \\
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

The time that the particle emits the light in the \hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{proper frame} is $t_{ret}= - \frac{||\mathbf{R}_{prop}||}{||\mathbf{c}||}$ which corresponds to the time

\begin{equation}
	t'_{ret}= \gamma t_{ret} = - \gamma \frac{||\mathbf{R}_{prop}||}{||\mathbf{c}||}
\end{equation}

then in the \hyperlink{def-Primed-Frame}{primed frame}, the \hyperlink{def-retarded-position}{retarded position}  at which the particle emmits the light pulse is

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{R'}_{ret} = - \gamma \frac{||\mathbf{R}_{prop}||}{||\mathbf{c}||} \mathbf{u}_p
\end{equation}

to find the position the light pulse is currently at, at time $t'=0$, we have to rewind its time from the position $\mathbf{R}'$ that it is at when using the \hyperlink{def-lorentz-transform}{Lorentz transform} at time $t'= -\gamma\frac{vz}{c^2}= \gamma\frac{u_p z}{c^2}$ taking away the displacement it propagated in this time to get the current position of the light to be (($t'_{prop} = - t'_{ret}$))

\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		\mathbf{R'}_l & = \mathbf{R'}_{ret} + \mathbf{c'}t'_{prop} = \left( \mathbf{u}_p - \mathbf{c}' \right)t'_{ret} \\
		              & = \gamma \frac{||\mathbf{R}||}{\text{\AA}}
		\begin{pmatrix}
			\frac{x}{||\mathbf{R}||}                                                               \\
			\frac{y}{||\mathbf{R}||}                                                               \\
			\gamma \left( \frac{z}{||\mathbf{R}||} +\frac{u_p}{c}\right) - \text{\AA}\frac{u_p}{c} \\
		\end{pmatrix}
		\\
		              & = ...                                                                                          \\

		\begin{pmatrix}
			\gamma x \\
			\gamma y \\
			z        \\
		\end{pmatrix}
	\end{split}
\end{equation}

we have the ratio of the propagation distance as

\begin{equation}
	\dfrac{||\mathbf{R}'_{prop}||}{||\mathbf{R}_{prop}||} = \dfrac{t'_{prop}}{t_{prop}} = \gamma
\end{equation}

\subsection{Setup of Spherical light Pulse}

In the \hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{rest frame} of a point source particle positioned at the origin $O = (0,0,0)$ and at time $t=0$ we have a spherical pulse of light that has been emanated from the source, which is propagated at velocity $\mathbf{c}$ (from last section) in all direction

for a time $t=T_{prop} \geq 0$, so that the position of any part of the light pulse is given as

\begin{equation}
	\label{displacement: proper pulse}
	\mathbf{R} =  c t
	\begin{pmatrix}
		\cos{\varphi}\sin{\alpha} \\

The \hyperlink{def-lorentz-transform}{Lorentz transformations} of the spatial and time coordinates gives the primed positions of the light pulse to be

\begin{equation}
	\label{displacement: primed pulse}
	\mathbf{R'} = c t

		\gamma\left(\cos{\alpha} - \dfrac{v}{c}\right) \\
	\end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}

at the primed time

\begin{equation}
	t' = \gamma \left(t - \dfrac{v}{c^2}ct\cos{\alpha}\right) =  \gamma \left(1 - \frac{v}{c} \cos{\alpha}\right) t

For a particle $p$ at rest emitting wave at light speed in any direction, we have the length the wave has traveled in time $d\tau$ as being $cd\tau$.
If we have a particle $p$ moving at speed $u'_p$ in the z-direction and wave being emitted in all directions from it, we have the wave emitted at an angle $\alpha$ from the z-axis, traveling distance $cdt$ in a time $dt$, with the particle moving a distance $ u'_p \cos\alpha dt$ in the direction of this emitted part of the wave, this leads to a bunching up of the wave in the direction of the movement of the particle ($cdt - u'_p \cos\alpha dt= (1-\frac{u'_p}{c}\cos\alpha)cdt$, the ratio of space the wave takes up in that direction compared to the \hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{rest frame} is

\begin{equation}
	Ratio = \frac{ \gamma \left(1-\dfrac{u'_p}{c}  \cos\theta \right) c dt}{c d\tau}
\end{equation}

since as wavelength is inversely proportional to the frequency, and this bunching up at the front will proportionally decrease the wavelength

\begin{equation}
	\Phi_r = \frac{c d\tau}{ \gamma \left(1-\dfrac{u'_p}{c}  \cos\theta \right) c dt}
\end{equation}

with the rate of change in time flow for both frames having the relation $dt=\gamma d\tau$ we get the ratio of this

\begin{equation}
	\Phi_r = \frac{1}{ \gamma \left(1-\dfrac{u'_p}{c}  \cos\theta \right)}
\end{equation}

the vector cosine relation is $\cos\alpha = \frac{\mathbf{u}'_p \cdot \mathbf{c}}{u'_p c}$, giving

\begin{equation}
	\Phi_r = \frac{1}{ \gamma \left(1-\dfrac{\mathbf{u}'_p \cdot \mathbf{c}}{ c^2} \right)}

The surface element spanning from $\theta$ to $\theta + d\theta$ and $\phi$ to $\phi + d\phi$ on a spherical surface at (constant) radius r is then

\begin{equation}
	\mathrm{d}S =
	\left\|\frac{\partial {\mathbf R}}{\partial \theta} \times \frac{\partial {\mathbf R}}{\partial \phi}\right\| \mathrm{d}\theta \,\mathrm{d}\phi = \left| r \mathbf{\mathbf{\hat{\text{$\theta$}}}} \times r \sin \theta \mathbf{\mathbf{\hat{\text{$\phi$}}}} \right|= r^2 \sin\theta \,\mathrm{d}\theta \,\mathrm{d}\phi
\end{equation}

The differential solid angle is

\begin{equation}
	\mathrm{d}\Omega = \frac{\mathrm{d}S}{r^2} = \sin\theta \,\mathrm{d}\theta \,\mathrm{d}\phi
\end{equation}%██████

A solid angle $\Omega$ is a measure of the amount of the field of view from some particular point that a given object covers.
The fraction of the field of view covered from a point is given by $\Omega/ 4\pi$

\subsection{Field Flux}

A \hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{proper frame} of a particle's differential solid angle element  (definition given in previous chapter (maybe move that subsection to here))

\begin{equation}
	d\Omega = \sin{\theta} d\theta d\phi,
\end{equation}

encompasses a certain amount of the wavefront, this is the same amount of the wavefront that is encompassed by the coinciding aberrated differential solid angle

\begin{equation}
	d\Omega' = \sin{\theta'} d\theta' d\phi'.
\end{equation}

We can calculate this element by differentiating both sides of equation \eqref{Cosine transform} with respect to $\theta$ \cite{hogg1997special}, which gives

\begin{equation}
	\sin{\theta'} d\theta' =   \dfrac{1-\dfrac{u_p^2}{c^2}}{\left(1+\dfrac{u_p}{c}\cos{\theta}\right)^2} \sin{\theta} d\theta =  \dfrac{1}{\gamma^2\left(1+\dfrac{u_p}{c}\cos{\theta}\right)^2} \sin{\theta} d\theta
\end{equation}

as $v=-u_p$ now using this and $d\phi'=d\phi$ (as the angle $\phi$ is always perpendicular to the motion of the particle and hence unaffected by \hyperlink{def-transform}{transformation} ) we have the solid angle in the \hyperlink{def-Primed-Frame}{primed frame} given as

\begin{equation}
	\mhl{
		d\Omega' = \dfrac{1}{\gamma^2\left(1+\dfrac{u_p}{c}\cos{\theta}\right)^2} \sin{\theta} d\theta d\phi.
	}
\end{equation}

%The overall amount of wavefront is conserved, as can be seen when integrating over the corresponding solid angle in either frame, both of which give the same value of $4\pi$.
%  proportional to the amount of the wavefront in the given proper differential element of the solid angle, and
The relative primed wavefront strength at a given angle is taken as being proportional to the amount of the wavefront per solid angle in the \hyperlink{def-Primed-Frame}{primed frame} relative to that in the \hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{proper frame}, referred to here as the aberrational wavefront strength weighting, given as

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq: aberrational wavefront weighting}
	\Phi_\Omega = \frac{d\Omega}{d\Omega'} = \text{\AA}^2.
\end{equation}

(define what I mean by strength weighting)

\chapter{Acceleration TODO}

To find how the acceleration of a particle transforms for an \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} in two different frames we take the differential of the velocity \hyperlink{def-transform}{transform} eq. \eqref{vector velocity transform} and use the differentiation rules for two generic functions $f$ and $g$: $d(gf)=f dg+g df$, and $d[f(g(x))]= dg(x) * df(g(x))$

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		d\mathbf{U'} & = \dfrac{1}{\gamma\left(1- \dfrac{v}{c^2} u_z\right) }
		\begin{pmatrix}
			du_x        \\
			du_y        \\
			\gamma du_z \\
		\end{pmatrix}
		+ \dfrac{\gamma \dfrac{v}{c^2} du_z}{\gamma^2\left(1- \dfrac{v}{c^2} u_z\right)^2 }
		\begin{pmatrix}
			u_x                             \\
			u_y                             \\
			\gamma \left( u_z  - v  \right) \\
		\end{pmatrix}                                          \\
		             & = ...                                                     \\
		             & =  \dfrac{1}{\gamma\left(1- \dfrac{v}{c^2} u_z\right)^2 }
		\begin{pmatrix}
			du_x + \frac{v}{c^2}( u_x du_z - u_z du_x) \\
			du_y + \frac{v}{c^2}( u_y du_z - u_z du_y) \\
			\frac{1}{\gamma} du_z                      \\
		\end{pmatrix}
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Now, divide by the time differential from the previous chapter to get the acceleration transform

\begin{equation}
	\mhl{
		\begin{aligned}
			\mathbf{a'} =  \dfrac{1}{\gamma^2\left(1- \dfrac{v}{c^2} u_z\right)^3 }
			\begin{pmatrix}
				a_x + \frac{v}{c^2}(u_x a_z - u_z a_x) \\
				a_y + \frac{v}{c^2}(u_y a_z - u_z a_y) \\
				\frac{1}{\gamma} a_z                   \\
			\end{pmatrix}

\chapter{Invariant Quantities TODO}

\hyperlink{def-lorentz-invariant}{lorentz invariance} of different 4 vectors, i.e. the 4 position, the 4 velocity, and the 4 energy-momentum vector
... If a physical quantity is \hyperlink{def-lorentz-invariant}{lorentz invariant} it means it is unchanged by a \hyperlink{def-lorentz-transform}{Lorentz transformation}
... having conserved quantities helps us model complex systems and experiments (frame-independent quantity)

Most of this is not as straightforward as the previous chapters, and more harder to relate to previous coordinates, velocity, and acceleration transforms as energy is a more abstract concept, but the main reason we cared about energy in classical physics is because it was a conserved quantity which is extremely important in classical mechanics, as it gives us tools to make calculations.

... we will try and find a quantity with the units of energy that will have a conservation principle associated
... the derivations to get the famous $E=mc^2$ use approximations, assumptions, and redefined definitions of energy and momentum, and the energy-momentum relation used quantum mechanics to derive, which would require another handbook to go into
... so instead we use the most important thing we need for energy to be and that is to have an associated conservation rule, which means finding a quantity that is unchanged between frames and has a quantity with the units of energy
... to do this we will start from the "4 vector" "4 position" which we already know the associated conservation rule from
... The \hyperlink{def-lorentz-invariant}{lorentz invariant} quantities are sometimes called proper time, proper position, and proper acceleration.

4-vector will introduce confusion

\section{recap the conserved quantity from space and time coordinates}

We defined the space-time interval between two \hyperlink{def-event}{event}s:

\begin{equation}
	\Delta S^2 = -(c\Delta t)^2 +\Delta x^2 +\Delta y^2 +\Delta z^2
\end{equation}

(can be defined as negative of this) (show this is \hyperlink{def-lorentz-invariant}{invariant} for any primed coordinates)
all inertial frames of reference agree on this interval (can show it always goes to proper coordinates in this form when subbed in)
the proper time between two \hyperlink{def-event}{event}s $\Delta\tau$ is also agreed upon in all inertial frames
and will also therefore agree on derivatives with respect to $\tau$ (where it is the time between two \hyperlink{def-event}{event}s in the same location?), because they will be \hyperlink{def-lorentz-invariant}{invariant}
we have the position of an \hyperlink{def-event}{event} in space-time given as a 4-position vector (what is a 4-vector)

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{S} =
	\begin{pmatrix}
		ct \\
		x  \\
		y  \\
		z  \\
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

taking a derivative with respect to $\tau$ gives us the 4-velocity 4-vector with $\frac{d}{d\tau} = \frac{dt}{d\tau}\frac{d}{dt} = \gamma_u \frac{d}{dt} $

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{U} = \frac{d\mathbf{S}}{d\tau} = \gamma_u \frac{d}{dt}
	\begin{pmatrix}
		ct \\
		x  \\
		y  \\
		z  \\
	\end{pmatrix}
	= \gamma_u
	\begin{pmatrix}
		c   \\
		u_x \\
		u_y \\
		u_z \\
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

know to show that the magnitude of this is \hyperlink{def-lorentz-invariant}{invariant} by showing all primed velocities give

\begin{equation}
	||\mathbf{U}|| = c
\end{equation}

The 4 momentum is defined as

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{P} = m_0 \mathbf{U} =
	\begin{pmatrix}
		\gamma_u m_0 c   \\
		\gamma_u m_0 u_x \\
		\gamma_u m_0 u_y \\
		\gamma_u m_0 u_z \\
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

we have the Taylor series expansion of $\gamma_u$ factor is

\begin{equation}
	\gamma_u = 1 + \frac{1}{2}\frac{u^2}{c^2} + \frac{3}{8}\frac{u^4}{c^4} + ...
\end{equation}

when subbed into 4-momentum, we have the time component and multiply by $c$, we have

\begin{equation}
	c \mathbf{P}_t = m_0 c^2\gamma_u = m_0 c^2 ( 1 + \frac{1}{2}\frac{u^2}{c^2} +\frac{3}{8}\frac{u^4}{c^4} + ... )
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	c \mathbf{P}_t = m_0 c^2  + \frac{1}{2} m_0 u^2  + \frac{3}{8}\frac{u^4}{c^2} + ... )
\end{equation}

all terms here are in units of energy, the second term is the classical kinetic energy, and the higher-order terms may be seen as higher-order kinetic energy terms that are very small for $u<<c$, the first term does not rely on the velocity of a mass, but only the mass itself, and this can be taken as a new type of energy all masses have even when at rest, i.e. the energy at rest for a mass is

\begin{equation}
	E_{rest} = m_0 c^2
\end{equation}

we will write this new energy into the 4-momentum

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{P} =
	\begin{pmatrix}
		\frac{E}{c}      \\
		\gamma_u m_0 u_x \\
		\gamma_u m_0 u_y \\
		\gamma_u m_0 u_z \\
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

the magnitude of the 4-momentum can easily be found to be

\begin{equation}
	||\mathbf{P}|| = m_0 c
\end{equation}

another conserved quantity that does not depend on the frame and using this and the 4-momentum vector

\begin{equation}
	m^2_0 c^2 = - \frac{E^2}{c^2}  + (\gamma_u p_x)^2 + (\gamma_u p_y)^2 + (\gamma_u p_z)^2 = - \frac{E^2}{c^2}  + (\gamma_u p)^2
\end{equation}

giving

\begin{equation}
	E^2 = m_0^2c^4 +\gamma^2p^2c^2
\end{equation}

for stationary particles $u=0$

\begin{equation}
	E = m_0c^2
\end{equation}

this does not work for massless particles like photons, we have to use a different method of getting this, we know from before that $ \mathbf{P}^2 = m_0^2 c^2 = 0$ leading to the components giving

\begin{equation}
	\frac{E^2}{c^2} = |p_{light}|^2
\end{equation}

and finally

\begin{equation}
	E = c p_{light}
\end{equation}

....
not needed:
definition of momentum for light borrowed from quantum mechanics

\begin{equation}
	p = \frac{hf}{c}
\end{equation}

where $h$ is Planks constant and $f$ is the frequency of the light
so that the
....

the reason we use this abstract 4-momentum, is because it is conserved and the Newtonian momentum is not conserved when it comes to special relativity

%███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████
\subsection{4-Acceleration}

... this is more complex and one difference in this 4-vector here is that the spatial part of the 4-acceleration is not parallel to the 3-acceleration in a \hyperlink{def-Primed-Frame}{primed frame}

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{A} = \gamma_u^4
	\begin{pmatrix}
		-c\frac{\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{u}}{c^2}                              \\
		\frac{1}{\gamma_u^2} a_x - u_x \frac{\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{u}}{c^2} \\
		\frac{1}{\gamma_u^2} a_y - u_y \frac{\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{u}}{c^2} \\
		\frac{1}{\gamma_u^2} a_z - u_z \frac{\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{u}}{c^2} \\
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

this is not really the same thing as what we think of when we think of acceleration, as it does not give the rate of change of velocity in the normal sense in 3d space

\begin{equation}
	A=\dfrac{dV}{d\tau}=
	\dfrac{dt}{d\tau}\cdot\dfrac{dV}{dt} \;\;\leftrightarrow\;\; \dfrac{dt}{d\tau}\cdot \dfrac{d}{dt}
	\left(\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} \gamma_u c \\ \gamma_u u \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{array}\right)
	= \gamma_u
	\left(\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} \dfrac{u}{c}\;\gamma_u^3\;a \\ \dfrac{u^2}{c^2}\;\gamma_u^3\;a+\gamma_u a \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{array}\right)

\section{Energy-Mass Equivalence}

*** E=mc2 is derived using an approximation for v<<c

Imagine we have a particle at rest emitting light in all directions so that afterward it is still at rest, but in another frame we have we have this particle moving and the emitted light aberrated, but we still need the particle to remain at a constant velocity after emission. (maybe include a rotation in the impulse/effect of light in each direction on the particle of has)

- if we have a ball in its \hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{rest frame} that emits a flash of light evenly in all directions, we will have the ball's energy decrease by the amount of energy of the emitted light, and it will remain at rest after due to the light being emitted evenly in all directions
- its kinetic energy is zero in this frame

\section{Energy-Momentum (Equivalence)}

*** Dirac derived this and used quantum mechanics to do so, which is out of this handbook's domain, still consequences of this equation to be explored, such as the "zitterbewegung"

Momentum in special relativity is defined slightly differently, to ensure that the law of conservation of momentum holds true in all inertial frames, as required by the first postulate of relativity (it is still approximately unchanged at low velocities). momentum of a particle with rest mass $m_0$ is given the

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{p'} = m_0 \frac{dR'}{d\tau}= \gamma_u' m_0 \frac{dR'}{dt'} = \gamma m_0 u'
\end{equation}

where $u'$ is the velocity of the particle in this \hyperlink{def-Primed-Frame}{primed frame} and $\gamma_{u'}= 1/\sqrt{1-u'^2/c^2}$. you will sometimes the mass of an object referred to as $m=\gamma_{u'} m_0$ which is the apparent mass of a moving particle.

(why not use the 3d time differential equation here?)

\section{Force Transform TODO}

*** one of the most confusing topics in special relativity, from the way it is defined, how it is derived, and how it relates to other things\newline

*** (a note that the 3-force in special relativity is specifically defined as the time derivative of momentum $\frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt}$ and not mass times the acceleration $m\mathbf{a}$, this is due to newtons 2nd law holding only for the first definition in special relativity) \newline
*** This means that acceleration turns out not to be in the same direction as the force in special relativity\newline

force derivation is confusing as most sources give the time derivative of u and v as acceleration, (are they using that each force has opposite and equal force, but that would not take into account the retardedness)

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{a} = \frac{1}{m_0 \gamma(\mathbf{v})} \left( \mathbf{F} - \frac{ ( \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{F} ) \mathbf{v} }{c^2} \right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{F} = \gamma^3 m_0 \, \mathbf{a}_\parallel + \gamma m_0 \, \mathbf{a}_\perp
\end{equation}

\subsection{not sure what this is}

The force parallel to the velocity of the \hyperlink{def-Primed-Frame}{primed frame} is unchanged, $\mathbf{F}_{\parallel \langle ' \rangle} =\mathbf{F}_{\parallel}$, and the force perpendicular to this is $\mathbf{F}_{\perp \langle ' \rangle} =\gamma \mathbf{F}_{\perp}$, with total force, $\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{F}_{\parallel}+\mathbf{F}_{\perp}$ and

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{F}_{\parallel} = \dfrac{(\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{v})}{|\mathbf{v}|^2}\mathbf{v}
\end{equation}

and substituting this into the formula for total force:

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{F}_{\perp} = \mathbf{F}-\dfrac{(\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{v})}{|\mathbf{v}|^2}\mathbf{v}
\end{equation}

since $\mathbf{F}_{\langle ' \rangle} =\mathbf{F}_{\parallel \langle ' \rangle} +\mathbf{F}_{\perp\langle ' \rangle}$ we can use equations above to get:

\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		\mathbf{F}_{\langle ' \rangle} & = \dfrac{(\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{v})}{|\mathbf{v}|^2}\mathbf{v} + \gamma\bigg(\mathbf{F}-\dfrac{(\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{v})}{|\mathbf{v}|^2}\mathbf{v}\bigg) \\
		                               & = \gamma\mathbf{F} + (1-\gamma)\dfrac{(\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{v})}{|\mathbf{v}|^2}\mathbf{v}
	\end{split}
\end{equation}

this is the same for the electric field as it only differs by some magnitude from the force.\newline
this is similar to how we get the reverse transform: (is it the primed velocity used in this?)

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{F} = \dfrac{1}{\gamma}\mathbf{F}_{\langle ' \rangle}  + (1-\dfrac{1}{\gamma})\dfrac{(\mathbf{F}_{\langle ' \rangle} \cdot\mathbf{v}_{\langle ' \rangle} )}{|\mathbf{v}_{\langle ' \rangle} |^2}\mathbf{v}_{\langle ' \rangle}
\end{equation}
